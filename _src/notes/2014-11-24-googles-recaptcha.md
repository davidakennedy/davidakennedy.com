Google's [ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) looks promising. From the site:

> Every time our CAPTCHAs are solved, that human effort helps digitize text, annotate images, and build machine learning datasets. This in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.

Often, solving the accessibility problem leads to innovation.
