Here's two of the best articles I've read about Facebook's upcoming changes and nonprofits:

- [Facebook Emphasizes the Personalization, Mobilization and Amplification of Content](http://www.edelmandigital.com/2011/09/26/facebook-emphasizes-the-personalization-mobilization-and-amplification-of-content/)
- [Facebook Changes for Organization Pages: Focus On Results](http://www.bethkanter.org/fb-changes/)

Facebook has begun to build its next generation of the social web, among a highly competitive social media space â€“ with Twitter, Google Plus, Diaspora and others innovating as well. The coming weeks and months will be interesting.
