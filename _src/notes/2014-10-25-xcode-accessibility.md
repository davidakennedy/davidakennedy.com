> Allow blind programmers to make more apps to help blind Mac and iOS users. Let blind developers enjoy the app creation process just as much as sighted users do by making Xcode and Swift fun and easy tools for everyone, sighted or blind. Let VoiceOver users follow the same instructions as everyone else, instead of hunting through the internet for obscure lists of convoluted steps, or simply giving up in frustration.

A developer who's blind via [An Open Letter to Apple Regarding Xcode's Accessibility](http://www.applevis.com/comment/31596).

A great read from a pragmatic, passionate developer. His letter serves as a reminder that that people with disabilities just want to do the same things as everyone else, and accessibility can be tough, even for companies that are pretty good at it.
