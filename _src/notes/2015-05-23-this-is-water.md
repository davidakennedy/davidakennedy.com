I love a good dose of inspiration, and I found it today with David Foster Wallace's [This is Water commencement speech](http://qz.com/410057/10-years-later-david-foster-wallaces-commencement-address-at-kenyon-college-is-as-relevant-as-ever/). I came across the link, thanks to it being the tenth anniversary of the speech. It's well-known, but I had never read it. You can also [listen to it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGaXzJGVAQ).

My favorite line?

> The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.
