Check out [Teaching Accessibility](http://teachingaccessibility.com/), an effort between disability advocates, schools and the tech industry to make all technology more accessible from the start. Also, see the [article about it in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/07/23/this-small-change-could-make-a-big-difference-for-accessible-technology/), and the push to let applicants know that having accessibility knowledge is "preferred" to land a job in the field.

Cool to see the initiative launch on WordPress.com as well.
