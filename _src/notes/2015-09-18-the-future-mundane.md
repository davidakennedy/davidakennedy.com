Nick Foster, a creative director and industrial designer, recently gave a talk at dConstruct called [The Future Mundane](https://vimeo.com/139358108). You should watch it. He talks about a design approach where you need to think about designing for others besides your ideal user, designing for how your "thing" interacts with other things, and designing for how it might work when broken or misused. It's great advice for the ever-expanding Web and all the devices that can access it.
