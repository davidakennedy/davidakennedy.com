Matthew Carter, the creator of the Georgia and Verdana fonts, talks about [his life in typefaces](http://www.ted.com/talks/matthew_carter_my_life_in_typefaces). I love his thoughts on constraints versus compromises:

> The question is, does a constraint force a compromise? By accepting a constraint, are you working to a lower standard? I don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged by something that Charles Eames said. He said he was conscious of working within constraints, but not of making compromises. The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle, but it's very central to my attitude to work.
