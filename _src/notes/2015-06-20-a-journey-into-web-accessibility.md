> I want to build more accessible sites, but when I’ve looked into it, I usually find myself lost in the details without any general context to connect all the dots. I’m not saying the general information isn’t out there, but rather that I didn’t know where to find it.

Steven Bradley talks about the beginning of his [journey into web accessibility](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/accessibility-journey/) in a series on his blog. He'll be chronicling his path in upcoming posts, and I'm excited to read his perspective. Many newcomers to to accessibility [feel this way and they shouldn't](/blog/welcome-to-a11y/). Welcome, Steven! Don't worry about not knowing everything, not getting it all right or whether it's perfect. Just treat accessibility for what it is – a design constraint. Constraints force us to push boundaries and think ahead, and accessibility is no different.
