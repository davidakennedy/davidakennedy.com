I really need to write my first WordPress plugin. Jesse Friedman, a 10-year-old who recently attended a WordCamp, took away what he learned there and [created one](http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-created-by-a-10-year-old). Great inspiration, and good to see a young one getting involved in coding early.
