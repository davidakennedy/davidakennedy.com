Aaron Jorbin writes about his [goals for the Twenty Thirteen default WordPress theme](http://aaron.jorb.in/blog/2013/01/what-i-want-to-see-in-the-twenty-thirteen-theme). He envisions an accessibility first approach, saying:

> Accessibility First would involve a few decisions to be made upfront:
>
> - Color choices with high contrast in mind from the start. This is one area that Twenty Twelve barely missed.
> - Color choices with multiple types of color deficiencies in mind since an estimated 10% of all males suffer from some form of color deficiency.
> - Making up for browser deficiencies, specifically the [skipnav focus bug in webkit](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17450)
> - Make sure that the design still looks beautiful when the font size is increased 200%
> - Following the [Theme Accessibility Audit Draft Proposal](http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/theme-accessibility-audit-draft-proposal/)

I love this approach, and taking Twenty Thirteen down this path would bring accessibility to the forefront not just in the WordPress community, but the web in general.
