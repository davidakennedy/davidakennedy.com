Last night, I attended a [great Meetup with the WordPress DC group](http://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/events/16888452/).

[Mitcho Erlewine](http://mitcho.com/) gave a [talk centered around smart WordPress development](http://www.slideshare.net/mitcho/extend-wordpress-beyond). Even though I'm not a developer in the traditional sense, more of a content guy wanting to learn more about code â€“ I found the talk extremely beneficial.

It wasn't so much a talk about code as a talk about the strategy of code. And everyone can learn from that.
