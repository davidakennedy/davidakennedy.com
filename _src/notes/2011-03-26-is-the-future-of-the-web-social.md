Mitch Joel gave a [great talk at a TEDx event](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh0obyhZPM8) recently that you should watch.

In it, [Joel](http://www.twistimage.com/blog/) talks about how the social web has the potential to make us even more social or less social, depending on how you look at it. At the center of all this sits one of the web's biggest concerns: privacy.

Which web do you want?
