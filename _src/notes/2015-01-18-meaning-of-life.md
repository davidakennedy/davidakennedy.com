Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the question, "[What's the meaning of life](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/01/watch-neil-degrasse-tyson-explain-the-meaning-of-life-to-a-curious-6-year-old/)?" Asked by a six-year-old boy, here's the heart of his response:

> "You manufacture it for yourself and for others. So when I think of 'meaning' in life, I ask, 'Did I learn something today that I didnâ€™t know yesterday, bringing me a little closer to knowing all that can be known in the universe?'"
