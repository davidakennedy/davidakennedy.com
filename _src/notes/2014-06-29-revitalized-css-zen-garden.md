I love looking at and viewing source on some of the newer designs over at [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). I especially enjoy the rectangle-inspired [Screen Filler](http://www.csszengarden.com/217/) by Elliot Jay Stocks. I'm glad [it's back](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2013/05/07/10_years/).
