I listened to this [interview Conan O'Brien did with Jack White a few years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJgY9FtDLbs), and it touches on a number of interesting subjects. These include creativity, art, technology and digital manipulation. It's great to listen to if you're a modern-day digital creator.

One of my favorite aspects that White hits on is deadlines. In the interview, he describes how he often won't start writing songs until a day or two before he has studio time booked. That limitation helps him just work, and the work is creating. I love how that approach blends creativity with regular, every day work and craftsmanship.
