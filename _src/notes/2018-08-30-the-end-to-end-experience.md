In this Ted Talk,Â Doug Dietz talks about [transforming the experience of children going through a MRI machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jajduxPD6H4).

I love this talk because it _truly_ looks at the whole experience, not just the main tool that provides the majority of that experience. One piece will always be one piece, until it's connected and made whole.
