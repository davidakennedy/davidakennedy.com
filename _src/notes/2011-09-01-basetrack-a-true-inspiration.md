I'm always hunting for inspiration and looking to learn new stuff.

Today, I found it. Check out this WordPress project – [Basetrack.org](http://basetrack.org/).

It tells the stories of soldiers stationed in Afghanistan and enables their families to keep up with them. It's an ambitious project, and if you watch the video (or view this [WordPress.tv post](http://wordpress.tv/2011/08/31/teru-kuwayama-taking-wordpress-to-war-basetrack-org/), clearly has made a difference in the lives of the soldiers' families.

I love it because it's WordPress, interactive AND tells powerful stories.

Awesome stuff!
