I finally got around to reading [Om Malik's interview with Brunello Cucinelli](http://pi.co/brunello-cucinelli-2/). The fashion entrepreneur has plenty of advice about life, business, technology and more that really hit a nerve with me. I especially liked his thoughts around work and life balance. Give it a read!
