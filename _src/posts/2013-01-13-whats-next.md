Friday was bittersweet. I finished up a [two-plus year tenure](/blog/sometimes-you-just-have-to-run-the-race/) at [The Arc](http://www.thearc.org), having the chance to work with some of the most passionate people I've ever met. Working there changed me in so many positive ways, I couldn't even begin to list them all. So what's next?

I've accepted a position as an Interactive Designer at [Rock Creek Strategic Marketing](http://www.rockcreeksm.com/) â€“ building websites and applications for its clients. I worked in many areas of the online world at The Arc. Because of that I learned that I really love building sites and applications, and this new position gives me the opportunity to do more of that. I'm excited to meet my new colleagues, dive in and create some fantastic web experiences.

Working at The Arc was an amazing experience, and I couldnâ€™t have moved The Arcâ€™s online communications in so many new directions without the team there. We [rebranded the organization](http://blog.thearc.org/2011/03/01/the-arc-launches-a-new-brand-identity/), launched a [national autism information and resource center](http://autismnow.org/), built new blogs with responsive designs, made huge progress on website accessibility and so much more. On my last day my co-workers threw me a great party, told their favorite "Dave" stories and brought plenty of brownies and beer (my favorite motivators! ðŸ™‚). I couldn't have imagined a better ending to my time there.
