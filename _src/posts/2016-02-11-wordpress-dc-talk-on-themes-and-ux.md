On Tuesday, I'll be [speaking at WordPress DC](http://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/events/228263492/), giving an encore of my WordCamp U.S. talk â€“ [Themes are for Users](/blog/themes-are-for-users/). You should come out if you're in the area and want to learn more about WordPress and mingle with the local WordPress community. Plus, as a new wrinkle to my talk, I'll dive into [Components](/blog/meet-components/), a new project from the theme team at Automattic. Hope to see you there!
