Yesterday, my colleagues and I on the Theme Team at Automattic [redesigned our blog](http://themeshaper.com/2016/03/30/themeshaper2016/), ThemeShaper. I say yesterday because we really did it in about a day. The project was part of a hack day at Automattic. We hold a few each year, and they allow us to work on projects that we normally don't have time for, need attention or experiment with something risky.

I'm really happy with how it came out. Fellow Automatticians [Kathryn Presner](http://kpresner.com/) and [Laurel Fulford](https://twitter.com/laurelfulford) helped make the idea a reality. The thing that excites me the most about the new look is that it's so flexible. We have plenty of space to iterate and add creative flourishes over time. Wow, hack days are fun!
