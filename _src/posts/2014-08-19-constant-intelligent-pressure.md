Five years ago I started in [Elon's interactive media master's program](http://www.elon.edu/e-web/academics/communications/interactive_media/).

I've [learned a lot since then](/blog/since-grad-school/). However, one quote has stuck with me more  than anything else since then. [Ken Calhoun](http://kennethcalhoun.com/), one of my professors said it while giving us advice about problem-solving for our flyovers, short one-week trips where we would gather multimedia material to build web projects for nonprofits.

I don't remember the full quote, just this turn-of-phrase about how to approach problems:

> Just apply constant, intelligent pressure.

That's it.

It has popped into my head over and over as I've worked to solve problems on the web and in life.
