When I ran cross country in high school, my teammates and I would often walk the course before a big race.

It made for good preparation. We could identify any trouble spots ahead of time, and it allowed us to plan how each particular course might affect our running style. I didn't like doing it though. I appreciate preparation, but to me, walking the course took some of the fun out of the race. You knew once hundreds of other runners poured onto the course with you, those turns and bumps would be different. Most of your careful planning could prove useless rather quickly. Sometimes, you just have to embrace the unknown.

## New Beginnings

I've done just that for the past few months and weeks. A year ago, I left my full-time job as a copywriter with a great company in one of the worst economies in decades to pursue a dream: I wanted to learn how to tell stories in a new way and I wanted to earn my master's degree. I always thought I would pursue creative writing further, but I shifted focus once I found the perfect program. I graduated in May with my [master's degree in interactive media](http://www.elon.edu/imedia) from [Elon University](http://www.elon.edu/), and have been searching for a job ever since.

A week ago, I loaded up a U-Haul truck, said goodbye to some dear friends in North Carolina and moved to Alexandria, Virginia, hoping to land a job in the Washington, D.C., area. That leap of faith worked. I accepted a job with [The Arc of the United States](http://www.thearc.org/page.aspx?pid=2530) as its new Online Marketing Specialist. The Arc promotes and protects the human rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and actively supports their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes. I'll be managing the organization's online presence to help further its mission. I'm thrilled to be working for the public good and helping the talented team there give a voice to those who may not otherwise be heard.

I'm excited that my new career opportunity will build on the varied skill set I already have, and allow me to expand my knowledge into new media further in all sorts of ways. If you [follow this blog](/blog/) or my [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/), don't expect too much to change. I'm still interested in all the same things, especially telling stories with technology and creating online content. And I'm so happy that my own story has taken this turn toward something new and exciting. Sometimes, you have to embrace the unknown and run the race.
