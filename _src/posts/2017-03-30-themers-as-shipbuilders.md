Working with WordPress themes can often be misunderstood. How could you build sites without knowing the content? I love building themes because I believe that a good WordPress theme can open up a new world to those using it. In turn, also reveal something unique about the site's owner to the world. I read a quote from [Henry Rollins on creativity, success and failure](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/henry-rollins-on-defining-success/) that reminded me of how I feel about themes, especially  when I finish one:

> I’m a shipbuilder. I don’t want to sail in them. I want you to sail in them. I’m just happy that they leave the harbor so I can have an empty workplace.

I feel the same way when I launch a theme. I'm more excited to start the next one than continue work on something from the past.
