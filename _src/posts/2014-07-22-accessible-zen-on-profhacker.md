George Williams of the Chronicle of Higher Education's ProfHacker blog featured Accessible Zen and other accessible WordPress themes in a post called, ["Accessibility Ready" WordPress Themes](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/accessibility-ready-wordpress-themes/55683).

The post is from February but I didn't run across it until today thanks to Twitter. It's great to see accessibility in WordPress getting some attention outside of the usual WordPress circle.
