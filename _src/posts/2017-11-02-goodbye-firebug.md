> When it came out in 2005, Firebug was the first tool to let programmers inspect, edit, and debug code right in the Firefox browser. It also let you monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page, which was a huge step forward.

Another classic web tool says goodbye. Just like [Thematic when it reached its end](/blog/goodbye-thematic/) last year, I have fond memories of Firebug. I haven't been in this business as long as some of the people I admire, but Firebug helped teach me _a lot_ about web development. It's how I learned to debug a website. Thanks for letting me view source in style, Firebug!
