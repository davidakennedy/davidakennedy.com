There's something I've been thinking about recently. Moving this site to the [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) platform.

That sounds a bit crazy, yes? Especially for a web developer like myself. Of course, the [differences abound](http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/) between wordpress.com and hosting your own installation but moving still appeals to me. Why?

  * I could focus on content more easily, instead of tweaking the site constantly. I  [do that](/blog/new-look-same-feel/) a lot.
  * I'd get world-class hosting. That's neat, and a step above my shared hosting! ðŸ™‚
  * I'd join a big network of sites and bloggers. I'm liking the direction wordpress.com is [headed design-wise](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/responsive-wp-com/) and I enjoy the [new reader experience](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/wordpress-reader/).
  * It would be fun to switch themes a lot! (see item no. one)

But what are the drawbacks?

  * I'd lose ultimate control. No more custom themes or playing around with JavaScript on my own site.
  * I'd have to rearrange some content. My projects and photos are custom post types so those would have to become pages without custom taxonomies. Some URLs would break since I use a different permalink structure than the standard one.
  * Achieving accessibility might be more difficult because it often relies on custom tweaks not possible on wordpress.com.
  * I'd have a ton of functionality at my fingertips that I wouldn't use.
  * Potential future employers and/or other web developers might wonder why I don't use something more custom.

All that said, I feel like it's even. I first thought seriously about this when I read [Ryan Imel's post about his switch](http://ryanimel.com/2012/07/05/i-moved-to-wordpress-dot-com/). It's something I'm not ready to do, but could be in my future.

What about you? Are you a web developer or tinkerer that's made the switch. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Comment or message [me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/davidakennedy).
