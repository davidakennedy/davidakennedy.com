Since I was 13, I wanted to be a writer. I became one, spending part of my career writing for newspapers, magazines, corporations and nonprofits. But then I found the Web and everything changed.

One year ago today I joined a company called [Automattic](https://automattic.com), with its mission to making the Web a better place. We make [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/), and contribute to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), the software that helps power it and enables millions to publish with the same world-class software as big-name publishers like the New York Times, Wired and more. That's a pretty cool gig for a former professional writer.

At Automattic, I work on the Theme Team, trying to make themes on WordPress.com the best they can be. I love themes. I best expressed that in my application to Automattic:

> I want to be a Theme Wrangler because I believe that a good WordPress theme can open up a new world to those using it, and in turn, reveal something unique about the site's owner to the world. A theme can become the centerpiece to someone's story. That's something I want to do for as many people as possible.

During the last year, when not focusing on creating and reviewing themes for WordPress.com, I've worked supporting our premium theme partners. I've had the most fun with that because of the sheer variety of tasks it demands. From triaging tickets to fixing bugs, reviewing code to launching themes, plus collaborating with premium themers to thinking about the big picture. It never gets old, and I'm excited about the future of premium themes on WordPress.com.

But really, the great things about being at Automattic aren't just building software used by millions or traveling to neat places to work with your colleagues. It's the mission and the people behind it. Every day you work beside folks who not only care about making the Web a better place, but you too. Everyone is empowered to make a difference. To write their own story in a way. Again, not a bad place to be for a writer-type like me. I can't wait to see where the story goes next.
