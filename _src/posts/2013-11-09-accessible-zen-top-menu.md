A few weeks ago [Nicolas Steenhout](https://twitter.com/vavroom), a user of Accessible Zen, [sent me a tweet](https://twitter.com/vavroom/status/395968011514814466) with a request I knew would come sooner or later.

He wanted a menu area on top of Accessible Zen. So I built a child theme to accommodate! ðŸ™‚ It's part of my [Accessible Zen Theme Pack](https://github.com/davidakennedy/accessible-zen-theme-pack), available on Github. It features a menu area in the header plus a keyboard-accessible features. Older browsers, like Internet Explorer 7 and 8, get the desktop layout because they do not support [CSS 3 Media Queries](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-mediaqueries).

I'd love to know what you think!

Happy blogging!
