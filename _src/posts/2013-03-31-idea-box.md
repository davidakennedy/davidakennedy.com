A few weeks ago, the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://consumerfinance.gov) released [Idea Box](https://github.com/cfpb/idea-box). From the Github readme file:


> ...a django app for collecting and surfacing ideas from users, in the vein of IdeaScale, IdeaX, and Django Voice. Idea-Box differs from these projects in its minimal, easily integrate-able interface. Idea-Box also takes a strong stance on transparency, such that ideas, votes, etc. are tied to specific users.

I was lucky enough to be part of the team that built it. I'm excited to see where it goes and what the CFPB releases next as open source software.
