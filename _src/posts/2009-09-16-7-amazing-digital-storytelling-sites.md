Stories. We love them.

From the moment we join the fray here on Earth, we engage in storytelling. People once shared stories over fires. They once drew tales on cave walls. Now, we trade narratives on the Internet â€“ in so many forms and fashions.

If you like spinning a good yarn, or being pulled into one, the web represents a gold mine of possibilities. Explore and discover. Experts and creatives find ways for digital storytelling to evolve every day. Where do you want to take it?

Here are seven of my favorite digital storytelling sites on the web. Take a look, and by all means, add yours in the comments section. Let's get a nice list going!
