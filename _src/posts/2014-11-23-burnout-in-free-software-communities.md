Siobhan McKeown has an excellent post on [Burnout in Free Software Communities](http://siobhanmckeown.com/burnout-in-free-software-communities/), with tips for how to avoid it. This tip is one that I'm trying to get better at myself:

> Think about the area in which you can have the most impact and focus on that doggedly. Tackling one problem will have greater impact on the project than trying to do a million things at once.
