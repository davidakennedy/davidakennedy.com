I've often said to colleagues that at times I don't feel like I'm a designer or developer. Most of the time, I feel like I'm right in the middle.

> I personally think that people who are skilled at frontend design are in a great position to help bridge the divide between the design and development worlds. They are [mortar](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/job-title-its-complicated/) that help hold the bricks in place.

Brad Frost recently shared [thoughts on fronted design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/), and a front end developer's role in the design process. It resonated with me in a lot of ways, Besides identifying with the being in the middle of design and development, he points out everyone falls somewhere different in the spectrum. That's the great thing about being a front ender â€“ there's so much interesting stuff to do and many ways to find it.
