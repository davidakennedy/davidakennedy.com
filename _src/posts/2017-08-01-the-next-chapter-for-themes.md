I wrote a post over on ThemeShaper all about [what's next for themes](https://themeshaper.com/2017/07/28/the-next-chapter-for-themes/). This paragraph sums it up well:

> Customers want their sites to look just right. They don’t want to learn a theme. So when the new age of themes begins, _promise me you’ll focus on what they want_. You won’t get distracted by the many different ways to extend this new editor or become mired in all the ways to prevent the abuse of customizing it.
