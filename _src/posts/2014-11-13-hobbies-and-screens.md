I have published a blog post each day for the last two weeks. That combined with reading a post by a colleague about the [time we spend with technology](http://annezazu.com/2014/11/06/presentism/), made me realize my life has slid into imbalance.

It's controlled by screens and consumption.

Publishing words each day has reaffirmed my love for creating. Building. Making. It doesn't matter what you call it, I like it. Writing consistently, even when I think I may not have anything to say, has forced me to find my thinking on subjects. I plan to keep at it.

However, it's also made me notice that most of my creations happen in front of a computer screen, and as a result, I spend a lot of time in media consumption mode as well. I'm talking about things like scanning my feed reader, checking Twitter or browsing websites. It serves as fuel for what I create â€“ things like WordPress themes, blog posts and open source contributions. However, I can't help but think I can find a better balance between the digital world and the physical one.

I need a new hobby.

Outside of work, I play video games, write code for open source projects and pen blog posts. All those involve a screen. I use to do CrossFit regularly, but having a new, baby slowed that down. I'd love to find something that kept my creativity going, but lacks a screen.

I'm thinking of getting back into running or trying to learn guitar, two hobbies I've experimented with in the past, My colleagues have helped inspire this as well. During [Automattic's Grand Meetup](http://davidakennedy.com/2014/09/24/first-grand-meetup/), I watched dozens of them deliver flash talks on all kinds of subjects that they find interesting. These ranged from yo-yos to spy plane history and so much more. My wife knits and I adore all the &"real" creations she makes.

Hopefully, I'll find something that sticks soon.
