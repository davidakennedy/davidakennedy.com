Today, I watched [Rocket Men](http://pbsamerica.co.uk/rocket-men), a documentary about the United States' journey to the moon. I'm a space history junkie, and I learned something new about the Apollo 11 mission patch.

Of course, Apollo 11 was the mission where Neil Armstrong became the first man to step on the moon. His famous words, "...one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind," related to inspiration behind the [mission patch](http://history.nasa.gov/patches/Apollo/Apollo11.jpg). All the other mission patches included the names of the astronauts on the mission. Not this one. Why? Because it was for all mankind. How appropriate!
