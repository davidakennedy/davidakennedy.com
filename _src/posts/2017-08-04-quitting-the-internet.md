Comedian Aziz Ansari on [quitting the Internet](http://www.gq.com/story/aziz-ansari-gq-style-cover-story/), deleting a number of apps like email, Twitter and Instagram from his devices:


> … Whenever you check for a new post on Instagram or whenever you go on _The New York Times_ to see if there's a new thing, it's not even about the content. It's just about seeing a new thing. You get addicted to that feeling. You're not going to be able to control yourself. So the only way to fight that is to take yourself out of the equation and remove all these things. What happens is, eventually you forget about it. You don't care anymore. When I first took the browser off my phone, I'm like, _[gasp] How am I gonna look stuff up?_ But most of the shit you look up, it's not stuff you need to know. All those websites you read while you're in a cab, you don't need to look at any of that stuff. It's better to just sit and be in your own head for a minute. I wanted to stop that thing where I get home and look at websites for an hour and a half, checking to see if there's a new thing. And read a book instead. I've been doing it for a couple months, and it's worked. I'm reading, like, three books right now. I'm putting something in my mind. It feels so much better than just reading the Internet and not remembering anything.

I keep thinking about these words because I identify with them a lot. Ironically, I read them after clicking a link on Twitter, but I have been [trying to cut back recently](https://twitter.com/davidakennedy/status/890600382358892544). Yes, that's a link to me saying that on Twitter. I recognize this isn't looking good for me right now, but progress happens one step at a time.

I've noticed as I've cut back more, my appetite for more purposeful reading has increased and my creative energy has felt freer. "Being in your own head" more has a way of making that happen. I started to walk and [run](/blog/running-again-maybe/) more recently — I think as a way to literally walk and run away from the screens. I crave that space. I'm going to keep heading in that direction, small step after small step. Purposeful seems much better than aimless.
