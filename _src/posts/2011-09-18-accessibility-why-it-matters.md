Today, I'm giving a presentation at The Arc's National Convention on accessibility. It's called Accessibility: Why it Matters, and it's adapted from [WebAIM's Introduction to Accessibility](http://webaim.org/intro/).

You can [download the PowerPoint presentation here](/assets/talks/the-arc-accessibility-convention2011-presentation_.pptx).
