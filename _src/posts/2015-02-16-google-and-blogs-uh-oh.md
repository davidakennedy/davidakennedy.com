> Everyone’s spending increasingly more consumption time dicking around in apps and snacking on bite-sized social content _instead of_ browsing websites and searching Google.
>
> Publishers are relying more on social traffic not because Google’s squeezing them out, but because that’s where everyone went. The dominance of mobile usage, social networks, and YouTube, plus attention-competition from apps, are the real problems for web publishers and blog writers.
>
