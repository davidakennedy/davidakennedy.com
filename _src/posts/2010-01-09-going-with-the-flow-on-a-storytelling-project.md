Every project has its challenges.

The winter term project I'm working on with my classmates at Elon University in London is no different. [We knew that it would throw challenges our way](http://davidakennedy.com/2010/01/09/going-with-the-flow-on-a-storytelling-project/), but the project hasn't even begun and we've faced a major one.

It snowed in London a few days before we arrived and the school where we plan to shoot shut down for the week. It snowed again today, so we're hoping the same thing doesn't happen Monday.

To combat the uncertainty we've brainstormed ideas for possible new story ideas and solutions if the snow falls and we have to change plans. And we will probably have to ramp that up because it's supposed to snow again tomorrow. We've also already shot one standalone project for the piece though, so starting the process felt good.

Ultimately, it's about going with the flow.

You can do the same thing, no matter what kind of storytelling project you're working on.

Go with this strategy:

  * Create a plan and a back-up plan for your project.
  * Go in knowing everything won't work out.
  * Be ready to adjust at any time.

It's a simple strategy, but one that can help you accomplish anything.
