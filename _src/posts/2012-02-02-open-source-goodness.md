In the past two weeks I stumbled across three awesome open source projects that make creating interactive websites easier. They are:

  * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/): a set of tools that's simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions.
  * [Project Argo](http://argoproject.org/): A collection of tools and best practices for building topic-focused sites in WordPress.
  * [freeDive](http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tools/freedive/): A tool that transforms Google Spreadsheets into searchable databases that can be embedded in websites.

Check them out! I'm excited to start using them.
