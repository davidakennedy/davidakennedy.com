Today marks Global Accessibility Awareness Day, an event that started in 2011 and has grown ever since.

If you want to know more, check out Marcy Sutton's Accessibility Wins blog for a [nice roundup of activities and resources](http://a11ywins.tumblr.com/post/119550846548/happy-global-accessibility-awareness-day). Even better, get involved and start talking, thinking and learning about digital accessibility. Today and any day is a great day to dive in!

If I were you, I'd read one of the articles or learn about one of the resources on my [Accessibility and Me](http://a11y.me) page. Then start tackling accessibility little by little in your every day work.

Happy Global Accessibility Awareness Day!
