Today, I asked a simple question on Twitter about [starting an accessibility newsletter](https://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/status/631911644369678336).

I received a few positive responses, so I'm going to try it. I've registered the domain, and signed up for a newsletter service. Now to create a sign-up page, and start writing some content. I'm calling it A11y Weekly.

The idea didn't come out of nowhere â€“ it's something I've wanted to do for awhile. Except today, the words of encouragement on Twitter gave me the nudge I needed.

If you have any thoughts to share for the first issue, send me a note on Twitter, or via my [contact page](http://davidakennedy.com/contact/).
