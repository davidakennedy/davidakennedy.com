Very excited to see one of my latest posts, A Workflow for Testing Web Accessibility with Free Tools featured in the September 2014 WebAIM newsletter. The post was inspired by a recent talk I gave at the CodeHer Conference. It includes this quote from the piece:

> If you approach testing bit by bit throughout the creation of your project, it becomes more manageable.
