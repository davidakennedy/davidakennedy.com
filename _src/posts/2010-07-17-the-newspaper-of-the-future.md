I must admit this [app for Apollo News](http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/16/ex-google-news-bing-engineers-set-out-to-build-newspaper-of-the-future/) looks neat, despite my hesitance to jump on the [iPad bandwagon]({{ 'blog/predictions-for-the-ipad/' | url }}) just yet.

The app learns what kind of content you like and recommends similar content you might find interesting. Sounds like a search engine in a way, only more personal. Worth taking a look and pondering whether or not this could be the newspaper of the future.
