Another year has rolled on by, and like many others, I keep thinking where I've been.

With technology moving so quickly, bringing with it many new applications to try and fresh techniques to learn, I wanted to make some goals for the new year. Resolutions? You could call them that.

  1. Recode this site using WordPress' 3.0's custom post types and HTML 5, plus develop a mobile theme.
  2. Complete a project in Drupal, Joomla or another CMS.
  3. Blog more.
  4. Learn more PHP.

Four simple goals, so we'll see how they go throughout the year&#8230; What's on your list?
