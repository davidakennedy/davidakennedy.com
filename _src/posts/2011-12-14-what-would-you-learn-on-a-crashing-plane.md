[This TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/ric_elias.html), given by one of the passengers on [Flight 1549, which crashed into the Hudson River in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549). His message is simple:

  1. Don't waste time.
  2. Eliminate negative energy.
  3. Be the best parent you can.
