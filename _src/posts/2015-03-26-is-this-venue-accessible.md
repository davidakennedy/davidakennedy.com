[Sean Gray](https://twitter.com/SeanJGray), c</span>o-owner, Fan Death Records and Accidental Guest Records, has created a site called "[Is This Venue Accessible?](http://itvaccessible.com)" to track the accessibility of music venues. He's been featured in [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/693-going-to-shows-when-you-have-a-disability/), [The Kojo Nnamdi Show](http://thekojonnamdishow.org/shows/2015-03-19/the-local-music-scene-disability-rights), [Vice](http://noisey.vice.com/blog/is-this-venue-accessible-interview), [Village Voice](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2015/01/a_disabled_musician_shines_a_light_on_the_accessiblity_of_new_yorks_venues.php) and more.

[Jake Reid](http://twitter.com/jsequential) helped Sean build the site with [Accessible Zen](http://davidakennedy.com/projects/accessible-zen/). I'm so excited to see Accessible Zen used for something like this.
