There's no better time to be involved in social media.

  * [Google Plus launched recently](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-google-project-real-life.html).
  * [Diaspora has handed out many invites lately](http://mashable.com/2010/11/23/diaspora-invites/).
  * [Facebook has followed the innovation of both Diaspora and Google Plus and started making substantial changes](https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline).
  * [Twitter added images to its repertoire](http://mashable.com/2011/08/09/twitter-photo-sharing-all/).

How will each platform differentiate itself? Who will win the battle for users?
