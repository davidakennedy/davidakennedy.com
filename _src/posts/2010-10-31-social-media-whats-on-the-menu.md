Social media for non-profits and small organizations can be daunting.

How do you convince your co-workers it's worth it? How do you approach creating content? What are some best practices for Facebook and Twitter?

Casey Golden, Bethany Stevens and I tried to answer some of those questions today. Casey is the founder and managing partner of the [Small Act Network](http://www.smallact.com/), a creative agency specializing in social media and software for non-profits. Bethany is faculty member and policy analyst at the [Center for Leadership in Disability](http://chhs.gsu.edu/cld/) at [Georgia State University](http://www.gsu.edu/).

Our [presentations](http://www.aucd.org/conference/detail/session_event.cfm?session_event_id=151&showday=0) were a part of the [2010 Association of University Centers on Disabilities Annual Meeting and Conference](http://www.aucd.org/conference/index.cfm/home2010). Casey focused on a broad overview of social media, how it works and why it's powerful. I centered my presentation on forming a process for creating social media content, and Bethany talked about Facebook and the best practices for that space.

We had a great audience, and lots of participation. See my talking points by [viewing the presentation on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B7sxizr7YLygSzQ0cWRGT0puQ00). You might find some of the information helpful as you and/or your organization dives into social media.
