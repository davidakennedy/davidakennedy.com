We all like free. Love it even.

And we value saving time much more, especially when building multimedia experiences. So here are a seven free tools that I've found indispensable:

  1. [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com/): Adobe's color selection tool makes experimenting and picking colors for projects fun and easy.
  2. [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/): Inspect and edit HTML in real time. Perfect for experimenting.
  3. [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/): A site packed with great web development tutorials. Learning CSS was much easier with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" rel="noopener noreferrer">these</a> at my disposal.
  4. [Kirupa](http://www.kirupa.com/): I just recently discovered this site, chock full of resources for all things Flash.
  5. [Twitter Lists](http://blog.twitter.com/2009/10/theres-list-for-that.html): I am a big fan of Twitter Lists. Follow these two I made if you want insights from [creative people](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/creative) and [interactive media professionals](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/internet-tech).
  6. [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/): The thing I enjoy most about Smashing Mag is that it always leads me to new and exciting things on the web.
  7. [My Delicious](http://delicious.com/DavidAKennedy): Want more links and resources from me. Check out my Delicious profile.
