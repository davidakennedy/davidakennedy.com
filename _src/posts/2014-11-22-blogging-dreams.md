I've blogged for 26 straight days. It has reaffirmed my love for writing, and I've had fun watching what has happened as a result. I'm going to write more about this later, but one thing I realized a few days ago centers on impact.

As a writer, you always want to make a difference with your words â€“ be helpful. In the last month or so I've had a handful of people I really respect link to my posts or call attention to them on Twitter. One teacher even used one post in a college class.

I'm writing every day and making an impact. Call me a writer. ðŸ™‚
