This past week, Automattic held its annual Grand Meetup, where the entire company gets together to talk about the past year, plan ahead for the next one and work on a few cool thingsâ€¦

Oh, and we throw a party at the end with a photo booth. As you can see, my team, the Theme Team, knows how to take a good photo. ðŸ™‚ I'm lucky to work with such a great group of people. They're more than coworkers â€“ they're friends. People who inspire me, push me, teach me, make me laugh and probably overuse the ðŸ’© emoji. Nobody's perfect.
