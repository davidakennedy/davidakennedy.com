In case you missed it, [WordPress 4.3 came out](https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/billie/) a few days ago. I contributed in a few small ways to both the default themes and the Customizer. After the release, I realized something even cooler than contributing to 4.3. I've contributed to the last five WordPress releases! It all started with 3.9, [my first "props"](http://davidakennedy.com/2014/04/16/logged-into-wordpress-saw-this/) in WordPress.

That's a nice streak, and one I hope to keep going.
