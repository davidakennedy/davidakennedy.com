The [blogosphere is lit up with talk of the iPad](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=iPad&btnG=Search+Blogs) a day before it comes out.

Some believe it's [far from perfect](http://gizmodo.com/5508130/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-think-you-shouldnt-either) while others [anxiously await the iPad's arrival](http://twitter.com/adellecharles/status/11487329856). Only time will tell how well the iPad sells, how easily people can use it and how they use it.

## Respect the User

Some four years ago, I bought a Palm Pilot. I had just landed my first job as a journalist and desperately wanted something to keep up with all my new contacts.

I think I used it four times. I ended up scribbling my contacts in my reporter's notebook, and transferring them to a text document for easy electronic transporting.

Why?

It didn't fit into my life. [Palm failed in a way with its devices](http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1898610,00.html).

It was faster to just scribble the name when on location and in a rush. The text file proved easier to get to and navigate than my Palm device.

## Is it just Hype?

I think the [Apple iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) could suffer the same fate.

Here's my thoughts on the iPad:

  * It could end up being a nice around-the-house kind of computer, perfect for checking email or browsing the web.
  * It could be too big for people to carry it with them everywhere.
  * As Cory Doctorow pointed out, [Apple has made a killing on closed off devices and applications](http://gizmodo.com/5508130/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-think-you-shouldnt-either).
  * However, the iPad might fall short of expectations because it doesn't embrace the free/open-source mentality that's gathering steam on the web.
  * I [don't think it will save the news industry](http://davidakennedy.com/2010/03/20/ipad-could-cripple-internet-and-newspapers/). The news is no longer a commodity. Anyone can distribute news these days, so journalists still have to figure out how to make the news they gather more valuable than most.

**Final Word**: No technology is perfect, so the iPad won't be the be-all, end-all some may think. It will have its fans and detractors. I'll give it chance, but would have to try one extensively before ever buying one.

_Note: This post is a short assignment for my class in Contemporary Media Issues about the iPad and its release._
