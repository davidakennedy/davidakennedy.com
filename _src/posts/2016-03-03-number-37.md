Yesterday, I turned 37, and got carded at dinner by my waitress. To be honest, she was likely carding my wife, and asking for mine to be polite. It's okay â€“ I'll take it. I had tacos and beer, so it was really just a bonus.

Well, I'm officially in my _late_ thirties. While that scares me a bit, I can honestly say that being older means I just worry less about things that don't matter. In the last year, I've tried to focus on the small details that go a long way.

I started using Habit List to track non-digital habits I wanted to strengthen, like reading, playing with my daughter and writing.  I blogged a lot more too, [dogfooding my company's new product](https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/). I've continued to contribute to WordPress, going to this year's Community Summit, and presenting at WordCamp U.S. But the biggest undertaking of the year has been looking for a new place to live. More on that later.

In the next year, I'm aiming to continue to focus on the small details and keep [building on the habits I've formed](/blog/2016/). I'm also looking forward to moving, and jettisoning some of the things I don't need anymore.

I experienced less gigantic life changes this year, but I started processes that will mean gigantic changes in the end.
