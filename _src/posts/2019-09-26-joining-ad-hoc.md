I’m excited to share that I’ve joined [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team/) as a Senior UX Designer, focused on accessibility.

If you don’t know, Ad Hoc builds digital services for the U.S. government. The company’s founders helped rescue [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) after its turbulent launch. The talented team has since launched [Vets.gov](https://adhoc.team/programs/va-gov/) among other notable projects.

I enjoyed working in this space before, as a contractor for the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to use accessibility as a lever to improve government digital experiences. The more I’ve explored accessibility, the more passionate I’ve become about it. It also helps that for me, the work has a [deep, personal meaning](/blog/why-i-care-about-accessibility/). It was time to give it my full attention.

What attracted me most to the position at Ad Hoc was that it was part of the design team. Along with my colleagues, I can advocate for accessibility early during the design process. It won’t just be about testing before launch. I started last week, and the first few days have been lots of fun. I’m diving into all sorts of different tech stacks, tools and challenges.

This new gig lacks something I’ve had in past jobs though: a focus on WordPress. While that means I won’t work with WordPress day to day, I imagine I’ll still be around the community. I’m so thankful for WordPress and the people I’ve met both in the community and at Automattic. Both have made me better in countless ways.

Onward!
