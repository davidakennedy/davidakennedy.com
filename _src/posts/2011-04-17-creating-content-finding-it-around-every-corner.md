Creating content often becomes an afterthought when planning a website. People want bells and whistles. Interactivity. Innovation. Well, none of that happens without good, solid content.

That was the framework for the [lightning talk I gave at last week's WordPress DC Meetup](http://wpdc.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/april-meetup-announcing-our-lightning-talks/). If you power through the the [quick slideshow](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52971713/Creating-Content-Finding-It-Around-Every-Corner) I put together below, you'll see a lot of what I outline is very basic, but embracing the basics first can help you reach beyond the basics. So much about creating content for websites and interactive projects means following a well defined process. Sometimes, that process is one someone else created, something you created or a hybrid of the two. Whichever it is for you, embrace that process and trust it.
