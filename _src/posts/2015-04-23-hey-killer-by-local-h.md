Few bands conjure up fun for me like [Local H](http://www.localh.com). I love their minimal approach to rock and the in-your-face style. Back when I first heard their music, it amazed me they were only a two-piece outfit. They still are, but they've [changed drummers over the years](http://www.localh.com/25-years-of-local-h.html).

I got excited when I saw they released a new album recently, [Hey, Killer](http://rd.io/x/Rl5GWuA-BFML/). Turns out, [fans largely funded the album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey,_Killer). It's not a conceptual release, like they've done in the past, but it's still Local H being Local H. ðŸ™‚ Give it a listen!
