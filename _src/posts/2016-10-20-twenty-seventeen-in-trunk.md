Last night, I made my [first commit to WordPress](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/38833/)!

[It's exciting](https://twitter.com/helenhousandi/status/788957937054130176)!

Twenty Seventeen, the next default theme for WordPress, is now in trunk â€“ the latest development version of WordPress. It's been a busy week after a flurry of work from an amazing 59 contributors so far on the theme. **59! **As one of the leads for the theme, that's a number that I'm most proud of, and want to see grow.

You can read more about Twenty Seventeen in its [merge proposal](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/18/twenty-seventeen-merge-proposal-for-4-7/) on the Make WordPress Core blog. Please continue to test the theme so it can be its best when it ships to the world. And thank you to all the contributors so far! This wouldn't happen without you.
