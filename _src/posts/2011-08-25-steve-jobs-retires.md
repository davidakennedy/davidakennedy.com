"It's a sad day," [Kevin Wenzel](https://twitter.com/#!/kmwenzel) said.

Kevin works with me at The Arc as a web producer. We're always talking tech, and today he was referring to [Steve Jobs stepping down](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/technology/jobs-stepping-down-as-chief-of-apple.html) as Apple's Chief Executive Officer.

It made me chuckle. Apple will keep [chugging along](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/08/apple-roadmap/), right? It had to happen sooner or later, especially with Jobs' health issues. But once I started thinking about things – Jobs shouldn't be known just as the visionary behind all things "i" – he's given us more.

[Matt Mullenweg thinks so](http://ma.tt/2011/08/on-jobs/). From an earlier essay, Matt points to Jobs' willingness to step on the gas peddle, even when a product might not be ready.

You have to always push and push hard. That's a good lesson for anyone in the tech world to learn, and it's a sad day when you forget it.
