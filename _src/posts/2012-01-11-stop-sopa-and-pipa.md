Today, WordPress asked its community of 60 million users to [act against the possible legislation of the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act](http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/help-stop-sopa-pipa/). You can [help too](http://americancensorship.org/ "Stop American Censorship"). This is an important thing to do for anyone who makes a living on the web. As Jeffrey Zeldman of Happy Cog and A List Apart [says](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/say-no-to-sopa/ "Say No to SOPA"):

> "(SOPA) [is] an ill-conceived lobbyist-driven piece of legislation that is technically impossible to enforce, cripplingly burdensome to support, and would, without hyperbole, destroy the internet as we know it."

Let's not let ill-formed legislation, written by people who know nothing about technology, destroy the Internet. Actually, screw that. [This isn't so much about technology as it's about freedom](http://vimeo.com/31100268). Act now!
