A few months ago I posted about my [reading habit, or lack thereof](/blog/my-missing-reading-habit/). Unfortunately, I haven't made much of a dent in making reading more of a habit. So before the year ends, I'll have to make a better effort to include reading in my day.

One thing I realized once I started trying to read more is that I lost valuable reading time when I stopped commuting. I used to read for 40 minutes or so on the train, and now I work from home. So I'm going to try to start reading after breakfast to try and reclaim that time. We'll see how it goes.
