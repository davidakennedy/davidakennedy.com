Sometimes the Earth has to truly shake to make you realize something simple.

When the earthquake hit the East Coast Tuesday, I first thought construction workers outside my office building had fired up the jackhammer again. Not so. Once I felt the rumbling, I immediately turned to Twitter. The tweets flowed within seconds. It was a surreal experience. Why?

It was the first big event that [I participated in on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/status/106061784846303232). I tweeted a few times, and then started reading, consumingâ€¦ I noticed something:

  * Twitter fed me real time information after the quake.
  * Facebook let me talk about it with close friends and family, and communicate with them that I was okay.
  * Google Plus let me surf a wider network with deeper analysis and threaded comments.

I couldn't get everything from one social media platform. That may not be earth shattering, but it's worth thinking about.
