Mike Rowe of Dirty Jobs fame [answers a fan question about whether following your passion is the right thing to do](https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/photos/a.151342491542569.29994.116999698310182/865520353458109/).

The question came out of this Ted Talk by Rowe called [Learning from Dirty Jobs](http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs).

Here's the meat of his response to the fan:

> When I was 16, I wanted to follow in my grandfathers footsteps. I wanted to be a tradesman. I wanted to build things, and fix things, and make things with my own two hands. This was my passion, and I followed it for years. I took all the shop classes at school, and did all I could to absorb the knowledge and skill that came so easily to my granddad. Unfortunately, the handy gene skipped over me, and I became frustrated. But I remained determined to do whatever it took to become a tradesman.
>
> One day, I brought home a sconce from woodshop that looked like a paramecium, and after a heavy sigh, my grandfather told me the truth. He explained that my life would be a lot more satisfying and productive if I got myself a different kind of toolbox. This was almost certainly the best advice I’ve ever received, but at the time, it was crushing. It felt contradictory to everything I knew about persistence, and the importance of “staying the course.” It felt like quitting. But here’s the "dirty truth," Stephen. “Staying the course” only makes sense if you’re headed in a sensible direction. Because passion and persistence— while most often associated with success— are also essential ingredients of futility.
>
> That’s why I would never advise anyone to “follow their passion” until I understand who they are, what they want, and why they want it. Even then, I'd be cautious. Passion is too important to be without, but too fickle to be guided by. Which is why I'm more inclined to say, "Don’t Follow Your Passion, But Always Bring it With You."

I identify with this because when I left journalism, I wanted to write novels and briefly tried. After a few months, it just didn't feel right. Eventually, I found a field that let me still create and tell stories, but with code instead of words. I brought my passion with me.
