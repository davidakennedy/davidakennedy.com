I believe writers aren't born, they're made. Word by word.

Lately, a few people I read/follow have [taken 30-day blogging challenges](http://om.co/2014/10/05/30-days-of-blogging/). It's got me thinking: Could I blog for 30 days or more? I'm about to find out. During November, I'm going to try to blog every day.

I think I can do it. I've blogged more recently, including 20 out of 30 days so far in October. I'm not going to do anything fancy: just use WordPress and Simplenote. Here are my rules:

  1. Posts must be to this blog.
  2. They can be scheduled ahead of time.
  3. They can take any format or length.

We'll see if I make myself a writer. ðŸ™‚
