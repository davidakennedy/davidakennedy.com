Chris Coyier posted a [roundup of recent conference talks](https://css-tricks.com/recent-conference-talks-worth-watching/), and [Steal This Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B69C0QvgOTk) by Wilson Miner turned out to be my favorite so far. He talks about how "stealing," sharing and collaboration overlap and why we should all trust each other more and work together for far greater impact. It's definitely worth a listen!
