I wrote a short post about [semantic HTML for the A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/what-is-semantic-html/). The topic comes up frequently in my day to day work, and despite the web already having its share of articles on it, I wanted to put it in my own words. LÃ©onie Watson's [understanding semantics](https://tink.uk/understanding-semantics/) served as my guide as I tried to sprinkle my thoughts into the piece.
