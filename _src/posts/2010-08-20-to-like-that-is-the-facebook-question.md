What's the last thing you liked?

Oh come on, you know what I'm talking about. On Facebook â€“ what's the last thing you liked? Maybe it was a sport, like [kayaking](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Kayaking/113479351995643), which does have its own Facebook Page, thanks Facebook [launching Community Pages](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=382978412130) earlier [this year](http://mashable.com/2010/04/01/facebook-community-pages/). But do you really like that? Or did you just opt into it when Facebook launched its new feature?

That happened with me, and I went back later and deleted many of the movies and hobbies that were linked to those Community Pages. I didn't think these lame community pages added any value to my Facebook profile. That got me thinking, "What makes us like a page?"

[Web Strategist Jeremiah Owyang](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/) has assembled an excellent presentation on [successful strategies for Facebook Page marketing](http://www.slideshare.net/jeremiah_owyang/the-8-success-criteria-for-facebook-page-marketing).

Here's what makes me like a Facebook Page:

  1. I'm involved or have been involved with the company or organization.
  2. I stand behind the company or organization's products and/or mission.
  3. I enjoy the content I get from the page.

What makes you like a page?
