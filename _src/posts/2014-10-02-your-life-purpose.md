I use to be obsessed with the question: What should I do with my life? Heck, I even [read the book](http://www.amazon.com/What-Should-Do-My-Life-ebook/dp/B000FBFMKC/). It's still one of my favorites. What I didn't realize was something Mark Manson points out:

> What most people don’t understand is that passion is the result of action, not the cause of it.

For awhile, I waited for the thing to find me. But I had to find it – by _doing_.
