Legacy media and other news organizations have begun to take social media more seriously, [creating positions that focus on the medium](http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4860).

However, few have set out to create a position as unique as the the [Voice of San Diego](http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/).

Its new [Engagement Editor](http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/clipboard/article_0dba4922-3c46-11df-a439-001cc4c002e0.html), yet to be hired, has people talking. It's part ombudsman, part new media guru.

Journalists [Erik Gable](http://erikgable.com/2010/03/31/10-things-that-could-go-into-a-community-engagement-editors-job-description/) and [Steve Buttry](http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/yes-engagement-is-everyones-job-and-my-job/) wrote recent blog posts about the position and what it means. Mark Luckie over at 10,000 Words [created a nice list of what journalists with similar and current positions do with social media](http://www.10000words.net/2010/04/what-exactly-is-social-media.html).

In his blog post, Gable asked what you would add to his list.

Here's what I would want to do that are similar to his ideas:

- Manage the organization's flagship social media accounts, reader comments and other reader-submitted content.
- Monitor new technology and teach staff workshops on social media and other new tools that may improve engagement. Help staff determine the best tools to use for different projects.
- Hold regular workshops for readers and community organizations to encourage new and continued reader-submitted material. Identify the potential regular and occasional correspondents for the Web site.
- Serve as the point of contact for readers and be the steward for conversations about the voiceofsandiego.org and its stories.

And I'd also like to:

- Organize and lead discussion forums and live online chats on the site about important events and stories. These could also take the form of a broadcast on UStream or similar site. Bring together community leaders to participate in these discussions in order to promote debate about topics.
- Create a portal on the site that would help readers better follow the bigger, more complicated stories. Think of it like a giant blog with easily accessed backstory.
- Establish a more social portal for comments and discussion, through a tool like [Ning](http://www.ning.com/) or [BuddyPress](http://buddypress.org/).

Like Erik asks, what else would you add?
