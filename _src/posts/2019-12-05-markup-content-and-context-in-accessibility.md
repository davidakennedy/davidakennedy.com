I'm excited to participate in this year's collection of accessibility posts over on [24 A11y](https://www.24a11y.com/). It's an advent calendar for accessibility knowledge that runs each year. Many people I admire in the field have written so many helpful posts over the years there, so I'm honored to have writing included.

My post centers around how important context can be in accessibility. It's called, [The intersection of markup, content and context in accessibility](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/the-intersection-of-markup-content-and-context-in-accessibility/). Give it a read. Hopefully, it helps you level up a bit.

Big thanks to [Carie Fisher](https://cariefisher.com/) and [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/) for their patience and editing to make the piece much better in the end.
