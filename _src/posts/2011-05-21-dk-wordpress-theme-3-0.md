A few months ago, I set a [few goals](http://davidakennedy.com/2011/01/07/new-year-new-goals-2011/).

One of them was to rebuild this site using WordPress' 3.0's custom post types and HTML 5, plus develop a mobile theme. Well, you're looking at that site. Thanks for the awesome work of the Automattic theme team, I've got a new site, coded with HTML5 and mobile ready, with responsive design.

## About the New Site

I created the site with [Duster](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/duster) as a parent theme, harnessing many of WordPress' most recent and powerful features. Duster comes HTML5 ready and includes CSS 3 responsive design media queries. It proved to be a great starting point. Other people that deserve credit for inspiration:

  * Justin Tadlock for [custom post type guidance](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/04/29/custom-post-types-in-wordpress)
  * Devin Price for [portfolio custom post type inspiration](http://wptheming.com/2010/07/portfolio-theme/)
  * [Sylvia Egger](http://sprungmarker.de/2010/wordpress-child-theme-for-twenty-ten-accessible-1-0/) and [Patrick Ramsey](http://slash25.com/2011/05/accessu-2011-accessibility-and-wordpress/) for WordPress accessibility tips

The new site brings marked improvements over my [old site](http://davidakennedy.com/2010/welcome-to-a-brand-new-site/). I used a child theme, took advantage of WordPress templates and used [custom post types and taxonomies](http://davidakennedy.com/projects/).

I learned a ton, and hope to do a couple tutorials in the future.
