Things have been kind of quiet around here. Man, I hate it when blog posts start that way. However, there's good reason for the silence&#8230;

## New Look

You'll notice a brand new site design! I just completed the final tweaks yesterday, and wanted to make the official announcement.

[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) powers the back-end, and I used [Shape](http://themeshapes.com/shape/) by [Ian Stewart](http://themeshaper.com/) as a starting point for the custom theme that you see. If you're looking for a place to dive into WordPress, WordPress theming and more, check out Ian's site, [Themeshaper](http://themeshaper.com/) and its [forums](http://themeshaper.com/forums/). You can learn a lot by browsing around the site.

Before the redesign, I used Ian's [Thematic](http://themeshaper.com/thematic/) to power my site. However, when I decided to create a new site, I wanted to learn more about WordPress theming from scratch, rather than starting with a WordPress theme framework. [Shape](http://themeshapes.com/shape/), this [tutorial](http://themeshaper.com/wordpress-themes-templates-tutorial/) by Ian, and a few [other resources](http://delicious.com/DavidAKennedy/Wordpress) helped me learn a ton.

I hope you enjoy the new site as much I enjoyed creating it.

## Story Practitioner Interview

A few weeks before I [graduated with my master's degree in interactive media](http://www.elon.edu/e-net/Note.aspx?id=946080&type=atom&departments=IMD&max=5), Kathy Hansen of [A Storied Career](http://astoriedcareer.com/) interviewed me via email for her series on Story Practitioners. Check out my [interview](http://astoriedcareer.com/david_kennedy_qa.html), and the rest of the [series](http://astoriedcareer.com/story_practitioners.html) for some great insights into modern-day storytelling.
