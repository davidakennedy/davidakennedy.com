In [The Year of the WordPress Accessibility Team](http://werdswords.com/the-year-of-the-wordpress-accessibility-team/), Drew Jaynes pays a big compliment to the [WordPress Accessibility Team](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/) and many of its members. He says:

> I think as we progress in further asserting accessibility in WordPress as a priority, we’ll see even more new faces make appearances in future releases. It’s a testament to the quality of work coming out of this team that makes, for me, 2015 the year of accessibility in WordPress.

Aaron Jorbin also [highlighted Drew's post](http://aaron.jorb.in/blog/2015/08/the-year-of-the-wordpress-accessibility-team-werdswords/) and said:

> Drew is completely on target here. The WordPress Accessibility team has been rocking it lately. It wasn’t long ago that the question of if the Accessibility team should exist was floating around. They were the only team without a product, but instead focused on things across many teams. Since then, the team has stepped up big time and really is making WordPress better for everyone.

Drew led the release for 4.2 and Aaron is a Contributing Developer, longtime accessibility advocate and recently earned permanent commit access. I had a huge smile on my face when I read both of the posts because I know how far our team has come. We're better organized, more focused and always ready to collaborate with the WordPress community. It's showing!

But we're just part of the reason for the successes Drew and Aaron point out. The bigger impetus for our progress belongs to the community. Everyone. All of you! When I talk to people in the community, the conversation has been less about "What is accessibility?" and more about "How can we work together to make WordPress more accessible?"

So thank you to everyone who took the time to think about, design for and implement accessibility in their workflow. We're all making WordPress better for everyone, and I can't wait to see what we do next!
