We know that media consumption habits have changed and evolved tremendously.

But have you thought about yours lately? It's an interesting thought, I think. [The Atlantic Wire](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/) has a cool series called [Media Diet](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/index/category/Media-Diet-18), where staffers interview top thinkers about what they read.

I stumbled across one of the stories, [what Jay Rosen reads](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/What-I-Read-Jay-Rosen-1735), via Twitter. It intrigued me, so I decided to write my own, What I Read. So here goes&#8230;

## Social Media

I check [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) when I hit the computer in the morning. First, I just check my normal stream for what I like to call accidental knowledge. The thing I love about Twitter is the fact people help me discover neat links and information I wouldn't have otherwise. After that, I'll check a few of my [Twitter Lists](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/lists). The usual ones I check are [Creative](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/creative), [Internet-Tech](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/internet-tech) and [Media](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/media).

After that, it's on to [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) to see what my friends are talking about and what links they're sharing. Most of the news I get from them falls into the category of what's happening in their lives.

## Feeds

Next, I check my feed reader. I use two: [Shrook](http://www.utsire.com/shrook/) and [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader). I love Shrook's beautiful interface for use on my Mac. I've used the [online version](http://www.shrook.com/) as well, but don't like it as much. All my feeds sit in Google Reader as well, just in case I need to access my feeds when I'm away from my computer.

What I read there really varies. I check my regular news feeds first. These are [NPR](http://npr.org/). [New York Times](http://nytimes.com/), [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/), [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/), [Slate](http://www.slate.com/) and [Salon](http://www.salon.com/). After that, I attack feeds according to whatever mood I'm in or what kind of project I'm working on. I typically check a handful of the 200 some-odd feeds I follow. Some of the more regular ones I like to read are [10,000 Words](http://10000words.net/), [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/), [Nieman Lab](http://www.niemanlab.org/), [Romenesko](http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45), [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/), [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/), [Poynter](http://www.poynter.org/), [Mental Floss](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/), [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com/), [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/), [Mashable](http://mashable.com/), [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/), [Tech Crunch](http://techcrunch.com/), [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/), [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/), [ProBlogger](http://www.problogger.net/) and [Search Engine Land](http://searchengineland.com/).

## News

On most days, I catch NPR on my local station, [WFDD](http://www.wfdd.org/home.php) â€“ out of [Wake Forest University](http://www.wfu.edu/). If I don't, I try to listen online. I also check several news feeds via my feed reader. These include the [New York Times](http://nytimes.com/), [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/), [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/), [Sports Illustrated](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/), [Slate](http://www.slate.com/) and [Salon](http://www.salon.com/). I also follow several news outlets on Twitter, and often hear of breaking news there. I subscribe to news alerts via email from the New York Times as well. Currently, I do not subscribe to any magazines or newspapers. I also don't watch much, if any, television news.

## Television and Online Video

I canceled cable a few months before I started graduate school, and haven't looked back. I'm enjoying all the free time I have since I avoid programs I'm not really interested in much easier now. I do subscribe to [NetFlix](http://www.netflix.com/), and love all the documentaries there. Some recent ones I have watched include Tyson, [Truman](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/truman/) and [Food, Inc](http://www.foodincmovie.com/). I'm also a frequent visitor to [Interactive Narratives](http://interactivenarratives.org/) and [MediaStorm](http://mediastorm.org/), always looking for cool, multimedia stories. Lastly, I like to watch my share of [Jon Stewart clips](http://www.thedailyshow.com/).

## Books

I love to write, so therefore I read a lot. I recently read [Googled](http://www.kenauletta.com/books.html), and The [Future of the Internet](http://futureoftheinternet.org/) (both for graduate school, among other titles). I also just finished [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](http://www.amazon.com/What-Talk-About-When-Running/dp/0307269191). I'm currently reading [Once a Runner](http://www.amazon.com/Once-Runner-John-L-Parker/dp/0915297019) and [Bad Luck and Trouble](http://www.leechild.com/badluck.php). My favorite authors are [Po Bronson](http://www.pobronson.com/) and [Paul Auster](http://www.stuartpilkington.co.uk/paulauster/).

## Fun Stuff

I watch some television series, thanks to [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/). I just finished [The X-Files](http://www.xfiles.com/) in its entirety. I'm also into [Mad Men](http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/) and [Man vs. Wild](http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/man-vs-wild/). And you know what, I usually can't make it a month without watching [Strongbad answer some emails](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html). My friends fill in other odds and ends via links on Twitter and Facebook.

That's my media diet. What do you snack on?
