> "One of the things I learned at Pixar is that the technology industries and the content industries do not understand each other. In Silicon Valley and most technology companies, I swear most people still think the creative process is a bunch of guys in their early 30s, sitting around on an old couch, drinking beer and thinking up jokes. That's how television is made, they think. That's how movies are made. And I've seen at Pixar that that couldn't be further from the truth. The folks on the creative side work as hard as any technology folks I've ever seen in my life; they're just as disciplined; the process is just as difficult and disciplined as an engineering process is. The contrapositive is true, too. People in Hollywood and the content industries think technology is something that you just write a check for and buy. They don't understand the creative element of technology. They don't understand that this stuff is created by people working extraordinarily hard, and with passion, just like the creative talent that they have. These are like ships passing in the night. One of the greatest achievements at Pixar was that we brought these two cultures together and got them working side by side."

I originally [tweeted about this too](https://twitter.com/#!/DavidAKennedy/statuses/108310317792112640). Hat tip to [Felix](http://felixsalmon.tumblr.com/post/9558033566/one-of-the-things-i-learned-at-pixar-is-that-the). I liked it so much that I wanted to post it as well.
