[My classmates and I](http://www.elon.edu/e-web/academics/communications/interactive_media/imediaclass2009.xhtml) at Elon University have been huddled together planning some very exciting projects for public good.

[My group heads to London tomorrow](/blog/planning-a-big-storytelling-project/). We've brainstormed and brainstormed and discovered that many of our decisions about our project will have to wait until we get on the ground.

We will be creating a multimedia Web site for an elementary school in London – a digital prospectus, so to speak. We'd love to have more knowns than unknowns, but I think we're learning that's part of the excitement of this project.

It's very journalistic in nature, even though it will serve as more of a marketing piece for the school in London. And that means reacting to what's happening (with as much planning as possible) rather than following a specific schedule.

One of my classmates, and the Creative Director of our London project, [Conor Britain](http://twitter.com/ConorOniMedia), spelled out a great strategy for us yesterday.

He said that we will plan to create a good project, but once we get in London, we will discover how to make it great.

I like that approach – for any big storytelling project.

You'll never know all the details. So plan all that is possible and be ready to be flexible.

To follow my journey in London, and the creative project my classmates and I produce, be sure to check this blog regularly. You can explore all the [posts about London 2010 here](/tag/london-2010/). Also, please follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy).
