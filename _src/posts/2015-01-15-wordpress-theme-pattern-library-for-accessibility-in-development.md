If you're a theme author, check out a new project started by the WordPress Accessibility team. It's a [theme pattern library for accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/01/15/wordpress-theme-pattern-library-for-accessibility/). It aims to make accessibility easier to implement in themes. Check it out and comment on the post if you want to get involved.
