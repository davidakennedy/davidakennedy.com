This site wouldn't be possible without the work of countless others.

## Thanks

Thanks to my wife, Joeleen, daughter Skye, and the web community.

## Site

The site is built on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), which runs on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The [11ty Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) helped get me going quickly. [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) provide the SVG icons on the site. [Reasonable Colors](https://reasonable.work/colors/) made it easy to create a fun, accessible color scheme. Type is set in [some old style fonts, courtesy of Modern Font Stacks](https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks#old-style).

You can find more details in the [humans.txt]({{ '/humans.txt' | url }}) file for the site. You can also [find the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/davidakennedy/davidakennedy.com).
