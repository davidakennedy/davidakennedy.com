description: What David A. Kennedy is reading.

A page detailing what I'm reading in 2021. Any must-read recommendations will have a heart &hearts; next to them. That means I could see myself reading it again. Other books may be worth reading, but I may not get as much value out of rereads.

You can also see what I read in past years, at least when I began keeping track of it:

- [2017](/reading/2017/)
- [2018](/reading/2018/)
- 2019
- 2020
