I'm an accessibility advocate who loves the open web and open source code. I curate a popular newsletter called [Accessibility Weekly](https://a11yweekly.com/). Before working on the web, I wrote words instead of code as a journalist.

Speaking of words, I've collected of few of my favorite posts I've written on this site and elsewhere. You might enjoy reading them.
