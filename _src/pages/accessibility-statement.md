I want anyone to be able to use this site, regardless of device, browser, network speed, or ability. This website strives to meet the level AA standards outlined in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

This page describes some of the accessibility features on this site, and how I approach testing to ensure it works well. If you run into any issues while browsing the site, [email me](/contact/). I take accessibility seriously and will fix any issues as soon as I can.

## Features

**Semantic HTML** - Pages use:

- semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<main>` and `<footer>` to aid in navigating the site.
- logical heading structure.
- properly labeled form fields.
- alternative text for images.

**Thoughtful design** - The site design uses:

- high contrast colors so it's easier to read.
- large type that respects zooming and font resizing.
- responsive design, so the site works well on any screen size.

**Testing** - I tested this site with:

- a keyboard to ensure it works well with a variety of user inputs.
- accessibility testing tools, like [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) and [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org), to help catch possible errors.
- screen readers, including VoiceOver and NVDA, to ensure the site works as expected.
