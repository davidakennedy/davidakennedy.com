description: What David A. Kennedy is reading.

A page detailing what I'm reading in 2021. Any must-read recommendations will have a heart &hearts; next to them. That means I could see myself reading it again. Other books may be worth reading, but I may not get as much value out of rereads.

You can also see what I read in past years, at least when I began keeping track of it:

- [2017](/reading/2017/)
- [2018](/reading/2018/)
- [2019](/reading/2019/)
- [2020](/reading/2020/)
- [2021](/reading/2021/)

The list:

1. _The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories_ by Ken Liu
2. _Pastoral Song: A Farmer's Journey_ by James Rebanks
3. _Butterick's Practical Typography_ by Matthew Butterick
4. _Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life_ by Francesc Miralles and Hector Garcia Puigcerver
