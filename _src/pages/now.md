A page detailing what I'm focused on at the moment. I'll update it when things change.

I'm currently:

- working on Healthcare.gov with Ad Hoc, focusing on accessibility and helping designers be their best.
- doing a lot of [reading this year](/reading/).
- dabbling with meditation.
- trying to make enough time for guitar and writing.
