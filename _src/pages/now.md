description: What David A. Kennedy is up to right now.

A page detailing what I'm focused on at the moment. I'll update it when things change.

I'm currently:

  * working on Healhcare.gov with Ad Hoc, focusing on accessibility.
  * playing video games on a new Nintendo Switch. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a blast so far.
  * Planning to move my [popular newsletter](https://a11yweekly.com) from one platform to another. I'm finally creating a full set of issue archives.
  * teaching a lot of first grade because of a pandemic.
  * reading [a lot more](https://www.goodreads.com/davidakennedy).

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
