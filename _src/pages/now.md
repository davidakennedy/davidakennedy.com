description: What David A. Kennedy is up to right now.

A page detailing what I'm focused on at the moment. I'll update it when things change.

I'm currently:

  * working on Healthcare.gov with Ad Hoc, focusing on accessibility.
  * Thinking about ways to evolve my [popular newsletter](https://a11yweekly.com).
  * still teaching a lot of first grade because of a pandemic.
  * trying to train my dog, Sunny, not to go bananas when he sees other dogs.
  * debating whether I should try learning guitar again.
