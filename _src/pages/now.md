description: What David A. Kennedy is up to right now.

A page detailing what I'm focused on at the moment. I'll update it when things change.

I'm currently:

  * Working on Healhcare.gov with Ad Hoc, focusing on accessibility.
  * playing a lot of Stardew Valley and Witcher 3.
  * reading [a lot more](https://www.goodreads.com/davidakennedy).

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
