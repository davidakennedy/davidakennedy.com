A page detailing what I'm focused on at the moment. I'll update it when things change.

I'm currently:

  * working on Healhcare.gov with Ad Hoc, focusing on accessibility.
  * playing video games, which recently include Stardew Valley, NBA 2K20 and others.
  * redesigning and reworking personal projects like Accessibility Weekly and Accessibility and Me.
  * starting to try to go on at least one hike a month.
  * reading [a lot more](https://www.goodreads.com/davidakennedy).

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
