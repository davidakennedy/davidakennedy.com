A page detailing what I'm focused on at the moment. I'll update it when things change.

I'm currently:

- working on VA.gov with Ad Hoc, focusing on accessibility and helping designers be their best.
- doing a lot of [reading this year](/reading/).
- writing [some haikus](/haikus/).
- getting used to a new town: Apex, NC.

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
