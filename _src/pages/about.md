I work as a Senior UX Designer at [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/), focusing on accessibility.

I'm an accessibility evangelist who loves the open web and open source code. I've contributed to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and the WordPress community in the past. Previosly, I worked with great people at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), [U.Group](https://u.group/), The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) and [The Arc](http://www.thearc.org/) doing all sorts of web stuff. In another life, I use to write words instead of code as a journalist.

I root for the Florida Gators, dig CrossFit workouts, love tacos and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, enjoy reading Raymond Carver, play video games too much and adore making my daughter smile. I have a lovely wife, Joeleen, one awesome daughter, Skye and one cool cat (Tigger).
