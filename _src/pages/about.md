I work as a Senior UX Designer at [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/), focusing on inclusive design and accessibility.

I’m an accessibility evangelist who loves the open web and open source code. I’ve contributed to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and the WordPress community in the past. I've worked with great people at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), [U.Group](https://u.group/), The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) and [The Arc](http://www.thearc.org/) doing all sorts of web stuff. In another life, I use to write words instead of code as a journalist.

I root for the Florida Gators and dig CrossFit-style workouts. I never turn down a taco or peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I read too many non-fiction books and play too many video games. I have a lovely wife, Joeleen, one awesome daughter, Skye, and a smart dog named Sunny.
