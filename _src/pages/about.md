I work as a Senior UX Designer at [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/), focusing on accessibility.

I'm an accessibility evangelist who loves the open web and open source code. I've contributed to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and the WordPress community in the past. Previosly, I worked with great people at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), [Chief](http://www.agencychief.com), The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) and [The Arc](http://www.thearc.org/) doing all sorts of web stuff. In another life, I use to write words instead of code as a journalist.

I root for the Florida Gators, dig CrossFit workouts, love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, enjoy reading Raymond Carver, play video games too much and adore making my daughter smile. I have a lovely wife, Joeleen, one awesome daughter, Skye and one cool cat (Tigger).
