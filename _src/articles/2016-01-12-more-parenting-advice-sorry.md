So I've [handed out some parenting advice](http://davidakennedy.com/2015/07/28/a-guide-to-parenting/) before to one of my colleagues. Today, we chatted about him joining the ranks of fatherhood any day. I had more advice â€“ even though I got annoyed when people constantly gave me advice when they found out I was going to be a dad soon. ðŸ™‚

Advice for being a dad, or questions to ask yourself when your baby is doing something new:

> 1. Is this a safety issue?
> 2. Will this end in forming bad habits?
>
> If no on both, try to talk to them about whatâ€™s happening and teach them something new.
>
> If yes, correct the issue (or clean up the mess) as best as you can.
>
> Then, always end by making a funny face or weird noise to go for laughs and smiles.

This has worked well for me so far.
