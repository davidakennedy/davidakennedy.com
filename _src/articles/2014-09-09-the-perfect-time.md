I love this talk by [David Berman](https://www.davidberman.com/) on the [current state of making things accessible and how it can lead to breakthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blp83MOfilE). Some quotes I like:

> It all starts off with designing for extremes. The key here is when we design for the extremes, everyone benefits. â€¦ We live in a time right now where it's never been easier to make everything accessible to everyone.
