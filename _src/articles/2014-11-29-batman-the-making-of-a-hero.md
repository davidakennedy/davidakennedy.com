Geek Tyrant posted about a rare find on YoutTube, a behind the scenes [making-of documentary of the 1989 Batman movie](http://geektyrant.com/news/batman-the-making-of-a-hero-tim-burton-batman-documentary). It's called [Batman: The Making of a Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASQbMs5xtCQ).

I was 10-years-old when I watched this movie in the theater with my dad. To this day, it still stands as one of the most enduring memories of my childhood and the first piece of media that really made me go, "Wow!" Ever since then, I've wanted to be Batman, anger issues and all. ðŸ™‚ I loved getting a peek at some of the behind-the-scenes material of the movie.
