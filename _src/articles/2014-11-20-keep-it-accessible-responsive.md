Thanks to a few [tweets from Russell Heimlich](https://twitter.com/kingkool68/status/534386847888474113), I ran across Luke Wroblewski's [notes on Jeremy Keith's An Event Apart Chicago 2012 talk](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1616). These lines have stayed with me:

> Responsive design isn’t about mobile or desktop design. It’s about the Web. The first Web pages ever were responsive from the start: they adapted to various screen sizes. They are also accessible by default. We do things to semantic Web pages to make them un-responsive and un-accessible. Instead of talking about making Web pages accessible and responsive. We need to talk about keeping Web pages accessible and responsive.
