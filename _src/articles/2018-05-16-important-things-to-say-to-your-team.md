Leading a team means you're context switching all the time.

One minute, you're doing some planning for a project. Next, you're chatting about someone's career goals. Later, you might be scanning your roadmap, thinking over what needs to be tweaked. With all that swirling around each day, it's difficult to keep the important messages in mind for your team.

Think of how your team feels. They do the work, and probably have more on their plate than you. How do they remember what's important? I'm not talking about your company or team goals, but the messages that will motivate them and make them think deeper about things like company goals. My leadership coach, [Akshay](http://www.akshaykapur.net/), calls these "campaigns."

To make this easier, I wrote a list.

1. We should be building the fire suppression system, not the putting out all the fires.
2. How does it look on mobile?
3. What problem are we solving here?
4. We're not just about themes anymore.
5. Make the future.

I look at this list at least once a week, trying to work it into conversations and communications with my team when it fits. The list evolves over time, but the themes within stay similar. They range from the everyday details that translate the craft to broad messages that grant perspective.

How are you communicating with your team? And are you saying the important things?
