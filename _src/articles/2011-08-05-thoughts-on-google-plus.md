Much has already been written on [Google Plus](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-google-project-real-life.html). Here are a few of my favorites:

- [Mashable: Google Plus Review](http://mashable.com/2011/06/28/google-plus-review/)
- [ReadWriteWeb: First Night with Google Plus: This is Very Cool](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/first_night_with_google_plus_this_is_very_cool.php)
- [NPR: Google Plus Thoughtful Answer to Faceook](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=137653562)
- [Beth Kanter: Are You Going To Adopt Google+ for Professional Learning/Networking? Why or Why Not?](http://www.bethkanter.org/np-google/)

Right now, the tech community and other early adopters have raved about the new social network. So far, it's received a [better reception than Google's previous effort – Buzz](http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Google-Buzz-fail). But only time will tell whether or not Google Plus will become a success. Here's what I think:

## Positives

- Combines the public nature of Twitter and the private nature of Facebook.
- Strong visually – akin to Tumblr.
- Strong integration with other Google tools, making it more valuable.
- Hangouts seem fun.
- Circles are intuitive, and the privacy controls represent a step forward compared to Facebook.

## Things to Improve

- It's a lot like Facebook.
- No integration with other social networks. It seems clear that Google wants to strike out on its own.
- There's no visible difference maker. What's going to be [the thing that pulls the masses away](http://www.briansolis.com/2011/08/study-will-you-abandon-facebook-in-favor-of-google/) from Facebook or Twitter?
- The mobile app has no way to reshare items.

The one big thing I'm a fan of, and that I've seen some people do, is using Google Plus in different ways than Facebook or Twitter. What ways are you using it?
