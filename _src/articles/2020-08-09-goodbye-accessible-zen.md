Seven years ago, I released a public WordPress theme that paved the way to new things for me.

It [taught me about accessibility](/blog/remembering-accessible-joe/). It set a [stage for me in WordPress theme development](/blog/dear-twenty-seventeen-contributors/). Some people [used it for amazing things](/blog/is-this-venue-accessible/).

I haven't released an update for it in more than four years. It's bittersweet, but time to say goodbye. I won't release any more updates for the theme.

Here's what that means:

- I'll leave the [project page](/projects/accessible-zen/) up for informational purposes, and so URLs don't break.
- I'll leave the code on GitHub for anyone interested, but include a note about the project's status.
- I recently took down the demo site at accessiblezen.davidakennedy.com. That now redirects to the [project page here on my site](/projects/accessible-zen/).
- In the future, the [WordPress.org theme page](https://wordpress.org/themes/accessible-zen/) will redirect elsewhere after the theme gets retired.

While it never proved popular, I enjoyed making Accessible Zen for the sake of creating. I got better at Git by working in public. I crafted changelogs like people would read them. The whole process made me think through features more carefully. I'd do it all over again.

I had planned to come back to it after the new WordPress block editor shipped. The theme's design would have made compatibility doable. But my other side project, [Accessibility Weekly](https://a11yweekly.com), caught on with people so I put more time into it. Since taking a new job recently outside of the WordPress space, I knew I wouldn't revisit Accessible Zen.

Thank you to everyone who used it, and encouraged me to make it.
