I've wanted to create a WordPress theme for a long time. I just didn't see how the one I created could be different from the [hundreds already available](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/).

However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized an accessible WordPress theme could help a my theme stand out. Sylvia Egger has done great work with [Accessible Twenty Ten Five](http://accessible.sprungmarker.de/) and [SeaBeast](http://green-beast.com/seabeast/) was well known years ago. But why not add another to the mix?

Yesterday, I [tweeted that I was working on this](https://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/status/232211208755896322) and asked the accessibility community what they wanted to see. I was happy to get a few retweets and responses.

**What would you want to see? Let me know in the comments.**

Here's what I'm aiming for at this early stage:

- HTML5/CSS3 with a mix of progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.
- Responsive design
- Visible skip links
- Good color contrast (meeting WCAG AA)
- High contrast style switcher
- Will meet current WordPress coding standards
- Will be open source and free
