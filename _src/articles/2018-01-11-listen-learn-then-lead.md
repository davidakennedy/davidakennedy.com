I enjoyed this [talk by Stanley McChrystal about leadership](https://www.ted.com/talks/stanley_mcchrystal).

One of my favorite takeaways, a quote from McCrystal:

> Leaders can let you fail and not be a failure.

That's powerful. It acknowledges that iteration can happen anywhere and with anyone, given the right approach.
