Fred Wilson on [the personal blog](http://avc.com/2014/08/the-personal-blog/):

> There is something about the personal blog, <em>yourname.com</em>, where you control everything and get to do whatever the hell pleases you. There is something about linking to one of those blogs and then saying something. Itâ€™s like having a conversation in public with each other. This is how blogging was in the early days. And this is how blogging is today, if you want it to be.
