Matthew Ström in [Well Designed Interfaces Look Boring](https://medium.com/mission-log/well-designed-interfaces-look-boring-568faa4559e0). He argues that design will lean that way in the future because it works, and it's what users want. We're seeing this in WordPress themes too. Users want less of an one-size-fits-all approach and more of a works-for-me design.
