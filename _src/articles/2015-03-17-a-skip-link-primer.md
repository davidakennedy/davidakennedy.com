Jeremy Fields writes the article about skip links that I always wanted to write: [A Skip Link Primer](http://viget.com/inspire/skip-link-primer). Most web designers and developers don't spend a lot of time on skip links, but they keep be as elegant of an interaction as anything else. I love finding ones that meld well with the site design and functionality.
