As someone who grew up on the "Space Coast," the portion of the Florida peninsula that is home to the NASA space program, I love space shuttles. Ars Technica has a nice video story on the [space shuttle _Enterprise_ and its place in America's history](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/09/a-closer-look-at-the-space-shuttle-that-never-got-to-space/).
