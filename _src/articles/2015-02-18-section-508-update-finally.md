Today, the United States Access Board finally and officially [proposed an update to Section 508](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/news-release). Section 508 is one of the big [accessibility laws in the United States](http://webaim.org/articles/laws/usa/), and the update brings the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) into the rule, applying it to web-based content as well as to offline documents and software. This change has been in the works for awhile, and even though it's not final yet, I'm excited to see it move forward.
