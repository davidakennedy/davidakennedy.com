Front end developer Kyle Rush, who worked on the Obama campaign's web team, blogged recently about its [custom-built fundraising platform](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/). It's a great read and has three big lessons:

1. Speed kills when it comes to donation pages and load times.
2. Build with flexibility in mind.
3. Test, test, test.
