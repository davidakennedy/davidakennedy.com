_When I give presentations on accessibility, I usually get one or two questions I've fielded before. I've collected a handful for an ongoing series of posts with my answers. I hope they help you understand accessibility better_.

**Is Safari better than Chrome for accessibility?**

No.

That's the short answer, but let's go deeper. People often ask this type of question because Apple has developed a good reputation around inclusive design and accessibility. Maybe its browser has an edge? They also wonder what browser and screen reader combination work best together.

All valid questions, but in today's "modern web" most browsers are comparable when it comes to accessibility features. If you're testing your design or development work in a browser with a screen reader, you'll want to stick to a few combinations:

- VoiceOver with Safari on MacOS and iOS.
- NVDA with Firefox.
- Edge/Internet Explorer 11 with Jaws.
- Talkback with Firefox or Chrome.

This post from [Maxability on screen reader and browser combinations](http://www.maxability.co.in/2017/02/screen-reader-and-browser-combination-for-accessibility/) has more information. And if you want some [survey data on screen reader usage](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/), WebAIM has puts together some on a regular basis.
