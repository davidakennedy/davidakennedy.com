> Actually, I don't view it as a competition at all. I think it's wonderful that there's a level playing field now. Anybody can upload their videos to YouTube and you don't have to get the blessing of some record executive somewhere to get your stuff heard. If your stuff is good, chances are people will hear it.
> <cite>Weird Al' Yankovic</cite> From a [piece on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2014/07/12/329873481/weird-al-yankovic-on-parody-in-the-age-of-youtube) about his latest album, parodies and the YouTube age.

I'm always interested on how the web intersects with creativity and publishing. It seems to be a similar story in many industries.
