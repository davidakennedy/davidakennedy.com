There's a [cool interview up with WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg](http://battellemedia.com/archives/2011/03/signal_austin_conversation_matt_mullenweg.php) over on John Battelle's blog. I heard Matt during a Town Hall with WordPress D.C. last month, and had a blast hearing his perspective on the WordPress, the web and more.

His comments about Twitter, Tumblr and social media are of particular interest here. I love this exchange:

> Battelle: I heard blogging was dead.<br/>
> Matt: Yeah, me tooâ€” on a blog.

Blogging still defines much of the web.
