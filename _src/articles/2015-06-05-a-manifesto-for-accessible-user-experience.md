Sarah Horton, David Sloan and a host of other people in the accessibility community have created a [manifesto for accessible user experience](https://medium.com/@accessibleux/rough-manifesto-for-accessible-user-experience-10a3ea34a3d6). They call if rough, so it sounds like it will evolve in the future, but it's a great read and worth watching develop.
