We all know social media can suck time away.

One of my favorite authors, [Steven Pressfield](http://stevenpressfield.com), did an [interview with CopyBlogger](http://www.copyblogger.com/steven-pressfield-interview/) recently, and talked about his life as a writer. One of the interesting things he said was that he refused to use social media himself because it got in the way. His publicist primarily monitors his social media channels. Does Pressfield have a point here?

Absolutely. Do you adjust the use of social media if you're working on a big project or goal?
