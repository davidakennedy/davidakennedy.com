Listen to Andrew Clarke, Jeffrey Zeldman and Dan Mall [talk about art direction and creativity on the Web](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/unfinished-business-episode-105-seventeen-coats-of-bullshit) in this episode of the Unfinished Business podcast. I loved this episode because of the great topics and how they intersect with the flexibility and unknown future of the Web.
