The last few weeks have turned out to be a pretty amazing stretch for me professionally. I attended [WordCamp U.S.](https://2015.us.wordcamp.org), my first "big" WordCamp, and gave a talk there called [Themes are for Users](http://davidakennedy.com/2015/12/04/themes-are-for-users/). You can [watch it on WordPress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/2015/12/09/david-kennedy-themes-are-for-users/). I also got invited to the [Community Summit](https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/community-summit/) and helped out at [Contributor Day](https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/). Plus, a few days ago, [WordPress 4.4](https://wordpress.org/news/2015/12/clifford/) came out, which included a new default theme, [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/) that I helped build. It's [on WordPress.com too](https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/12/10/new-theme-twenty-sixteen/).

That doesn't even count all the great people from the WordPress community I met in real life at WordCamp U.S., putting faces and voices behind the Gravatars. I can't wait for the next year in WordPress.
