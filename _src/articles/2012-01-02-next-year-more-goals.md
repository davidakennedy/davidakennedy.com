I [set a few goals at the beginning of 2011](/blog/new-year-new-goals-2011/). I wanted to:

>   1. Recode this site using WordPress' 3.0's custom post types and HTML5, plus develop a mobile theme.
>   2. Complete a project in Drupal, Joomla or another CMS.
>   3. Blog more.
>   4. Learn more PHP.

So how did I do? I [launched a new site in May](/blog/dk-wordpress-theme-3-0/), right on par with what I wanted to create. I didn't quite build a site in Drupal or Joomla, but [re-skinned a site using Blackbaud NetCommunity](/projects/the-arc-new-brand/). Not bad. I wrote 42 posts this year, about 10 less than last year, even though it feels like I wrote more. I'm definitely more comfortable with PHP, thanks to a few WordPress projects.

The new year has me thinking about what goals to set for this year.

  1. Blog more, and better (yep, going to have to improve over last year).
  2. Learn more about [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) (and possibly add or create a new theme for my site that integrates it).
  3. Launch an Elon iMedia Community website, based on [BuddyPress](http://buddypress.org/) â€“ something I've stated in 2011.
  4. Read more books on tech (first up is [Designing with Progressive Enhancement](http://filamentgroup.com/dwpe/) then some of the books by [Chip and Dan Heath](http://www.amazon.com/Chip-Heath/e/B000APJJZC/)).
  5. Become more proficient in project management (I know the basic principles, but want to grow my skills).
