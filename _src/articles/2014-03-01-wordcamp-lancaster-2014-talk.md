Today, I attended and spoke at my first WordCamp â€“ [WordCamp Lancaster](http://2014.lancasterpa.wordcamp.org/). You can check out the slides for the talk: [Lessons from Building an Accessible WordPress Theme on Github](http://davidakennedy.github.io/wclc2014/). Be on the lookout for a blog post about the talk some time in the near future.
