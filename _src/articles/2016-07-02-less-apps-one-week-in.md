A week ago, I came to the realization that I'd hit [app overload](/blog/app-overload/). So I took action.

I deleted a number of apps from both my iPhone and iPad, my two primary iOS devices. The hitlist included Facebook, Twitter, MeetUp, Google Plus, Tumblr and more. In the last week, I've used only the web versions of Facebook and Twitter on those devices. It has felt both freeing and only slightly restrictive. To be honest, I don't _think_ I'm going back to the native apps.

I think I only had notifications enabled on Facebook and Twitter, and I probably used those two the most out of the deleted bunch. That said, just glancing at my home screen feels much less stressful. Every app there has provides more value than novelty. When I pop open my phone, I'm much less likely to get sucked into mindlessly browsing content, which is amazing. I now have small chunks of time for more important things.

It's not that I think Facebook or Twitter don't provide value. They do. They connect me with both real-life friends and online friends in a way I can't achieve on my own. It's more that I want to nuture and engage with those connections on my time, rather than know the second someone leaves a comment or like.

This new experiment has its faults though. My friends in town have a Facebook group that we use to coordinate events and fun stuff. A friend posted late one afternoon that he'd like to go to the movies that night. It balooned into a quick, last-minute event that I missed because I saw it too late. That likely wouldn't have happened had I had the app, enabled with notifications.

But I still think a missing the occasional news or event is better than missing out on some of life's little pleasures. I plan to keep this up, and see how it goes in the future. Maybe it will stick, and maybe it won't.
