Dave Shea, creator of CSS Zen Garden, gave a talk called [A Brief History of Web Design](https://vimeo.com/134934221) that takes you through the time and space that is the first few decades of the web design.

When I watched this talk, it made me excited for the future, and wishful that I had found the Web sooner. Even though I wasn't one of the early bloggers, or even in web design in the early 2000s, I want that intense, personal exploration and sharing back.
