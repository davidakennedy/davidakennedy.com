Sam Altman wrote down a few [life lessons](http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short) for his thirtieth birthday. They're worth a read, especially if you're like me and have questioned how you spend your time, and whether it truly creates the impact you want. I've done that a lot this year, and have begun to make some changes.
