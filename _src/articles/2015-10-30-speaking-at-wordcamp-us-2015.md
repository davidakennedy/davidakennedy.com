I'm excited to share I'll be [speaking at WordCamp US 2015](https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/10/30/introducing-the-wordcamp-us-speakers-part-3/)! I'm working on a talk called, Themes are for Users, all about the user experience around WordPress themes. I hope to see you there!

This is my first "big" WordCamp as I never attended WordCamp San Francisco, so I'll get to meet a lot of people in person for the first time. If we've interacted in the WordPress community over the years, please come say "Hello!" ðŸ™‚
