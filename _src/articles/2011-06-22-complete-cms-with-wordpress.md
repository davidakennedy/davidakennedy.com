I have seen this tweeted and blogged about in a few places, so it's worth a mention. The cool thing about the [Bangor Daily News' new WordPress site](http://publisherblog.automattic.com/2011/06/20/bangor-daily-news-a-complete-publishing-system-on-wordpress/) is that it integrates with Google Docs, making one complete content management system. I'd love to see a post in the future about how this works for them.
