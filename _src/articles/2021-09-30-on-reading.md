Back in 2015, I wrote a pair of posts about [how I struggled](/blog/my-missing-reading-habit/) to [read more](/blog/my-still-missing-reading-habit/) at the time. I've come a long way since then.

In 2017, I began reading in earnest, finishing nine books. In the following years, I read 22, 35 and 28 books. What changed? It became hobby number one.

Let's review the challenges I shared previously. Twitter and web browsing distracted me from engaging with books. I failed to keep up any reading momentum, losing interest in books. I didn't carve out the time for reading itself, maybe expecting it to happen on its own.

The reason I improved my reading time came down to a few things.

**Reading on a whim**: Alan Jacobs encourages reading at "Whim" in [his book on the subject](https://bookshop.org/books/the-pleasures-of-reading-in-an-age-of-distraction/9780199747498). It means following your inclination for reading, not what you think you should read. This made me speed through books that I enjoyed. Pick up books I may have felt guilty about. Abandon books that didn't hold me. It led me to read more nonfiction than fiction, and embrace that. I'm a former journalist after all, and I find real life too interesting.

Inclination over perfectly planned. This creates a virtuous cycle. The more you read that excites you, the more you're excited to read.

**Dedicating time to it**: This doesn't mean that I read at a certain time each day. It does mean that I read before bed, sometimes when I first wake up and in small pockets of time throughout the day. I don't watch much TV. I cut social media way back. Reading won. It proved more nourishing for me so long as I follow my whim. Finding the time happens because I want to see what I learn next.

Sounds clich√©, I know. But most worthwhile pursuits in life grow out of small bursts of effort here and there. They add up. Then you have something formative. I approach reading like this now. It's a habit.

If you're wondering what book I'm into currently, I have a [reading page](/reading/) now. Happy reading!
