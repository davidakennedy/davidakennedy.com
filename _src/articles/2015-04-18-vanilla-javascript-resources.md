I challenged myself today to take some jQuery I used for an off-canvas slide-out menu and turn it into vanilla JavaScript.

I still have some work to do, but am about half way there. Two resources that I found very useful:

  * [A Dive Into Plain JavaScript](http://blog.adtile.me/2014/01/16/a-dive-into-plain-javascript/)
  * [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com)
