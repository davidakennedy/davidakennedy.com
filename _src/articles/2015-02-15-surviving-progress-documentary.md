I've binge-watched a lot of documentaries lately. [Surviving Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_Progress), a film that explores the present-day impact of civilization on the world at large, turns out to be [one of my favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IAs3tMZneM). It's available on Netflix and most online video services. Not to spoil it, but we need to be more ethical and consume less if we want to survive and thrive.
