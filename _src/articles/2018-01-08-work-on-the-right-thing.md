We always think we can do more than we can. Myself included. That hasn't changed since taking on a leadership role.

Multiple bosses have told me that I "take on too much." Recently, several members of my team said the same thing to me. Why do I do it? Lots of reasons. Like my team might already have a big to-do list so I don't want to burden them. Or I want to contribute, and feel like I've knocked something off the list. I might even think I can do it quicker than anyone else.

No matter the intentions, many times those reasons end up being selfish. Especially if I fail to help my project, team or company.

[Daily habits and routines build up from triggers](https://jamesclear.com/habit-triggers) – the thing that starts a habit forming. I've found two triggers that have started helping me make sure I'm working on the right thing:

1. If I have the urge to add a task to my to-do list, I ask, "Will this help my team or a specific project?" If they answer isn't "The team," I try to delegate the task.
2. When I start a task, I try to ask myself the same question. That way, I have a filtered process, meaning it's harder for the wrong tasks to make it through to my day.

I'm not perfect, but using these triggers has meant delegating more and working on the right things for me. If I hesitate, I try to think of the advice my colleague, [Brie](http://brie.blog) shared – "Delegate until you're uncomfortable." If that doesn't work, I can usually hear my team's voices, "Delegate, DK!"
