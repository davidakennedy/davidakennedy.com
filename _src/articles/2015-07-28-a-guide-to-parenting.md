One of my fellow Automatticians announced today that he and his wife expect a baby in the coming months. I'm thrilled for him. They have an amazing journey ahead. Part of our conversation included my guide to parenting, in four easy steps!

> You will be entering a period where everyone you talk to, strangers included, will give you advice about being a parent. So I will give you mine. ðŸ™‚
>
> 1. Accept that you know nothing, and be okay with that. Every day is a learning opportunity. Iterate.
> 2. Talk to your wife; **a lot**; Constantly; Good communication really helped us get through all the unknowns and known unknowns. After you talk to her, thank her for what sheâ€™s doing â€“ do that at least once a day.
> 3. Have fun. Even when you get baby poop on you, it will be okay!
> 4. If anyone tells you to save up on your sleep now, punch them in the face. It is not possible to "save" sleep.

Maybe this will help you too!
