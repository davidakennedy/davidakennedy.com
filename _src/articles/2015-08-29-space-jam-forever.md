Rolling Stone has the story of how a ragtag group of young coders skirted the studio and [created a pop culture sensation that's still standing two decades later](http://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/space-jam-forever-the-website-that-wouldnt-die-20150819). Hint: [it's this](http://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm).

I loved reading this story, especially how they managed to get the site back online. Oh, and the early notes and ideas sketched on paper for the site are just awesome.
