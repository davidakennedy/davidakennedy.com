I really like the idea behind Melanie Richards' [Just Build Websites](https://github.com/melanierichards/just-build-websites) repository. It's full of doable, neat and fun ideas you can use to stretch your knowledge and learn something new. She [writes about it](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/just-build-websites/) on her website. You now have no excuse for not having a good idea for a side project. ðŸ™‚
