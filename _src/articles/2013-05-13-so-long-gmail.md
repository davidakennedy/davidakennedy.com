I ditched Gmail this weekend. Permanently.

I had contemplated the move for a long time. One of my friends jokingly responded to my tweet about it with:

> "WHY DAVE WHY?"

It does sound kind of crazy when you think about it, but here's why:

- I'd read Marco Arment's, [Let us pay for this service so it won’t go down](http://www.marco.org/2011/04/05/let-us-pay-for-this-service-so-it-wont-go-down), and was inspired to rethink how I managed my own data.
- I liked the idea that my email was mine. No matter what happens to my provider, I can take it with me, both in name and data.
- I wanted to make things simpler. No more multiple emails – just one for everything.

I'm now with [FastMail](http://fastmail.fm). Funny thing: I used FastMail as my email provider before I switched to Gmail in 2008. Since then, they've seen a lot of changes. Opera [bought FastMail in 2010](http://business.opera.com/press/releases/general/opera-acquires-fastmail.fm) and recently [redesigned the interface](http://blog.fastmail.fm/2012/10/30/new-interface-and-login-screens-rolled-out/). Plus, now you can use your own domain.

I'm pleased with the switch. Pushing the delete button on Gmail wasn't that hard with a bit of planning. I:

- followed the [import instructions](https://www.fastmail.fm/help/business_migrate.html) according to FastMail.
- set up new [filtering rules](https://www.fastmail.fm/help/managing_email.html).
- waited a few weeks to make sure I changed email addresses where I needed to and let everyone know of the change.

It's good to be in control.
