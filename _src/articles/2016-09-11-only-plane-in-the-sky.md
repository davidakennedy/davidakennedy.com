I love oral histories, and this is one that's been [largely untold about one of the most defining days in U.S. history](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/were-the-only-plane-in-the-sky-214230).

If you're an American, you remember how confusing, sad and scary that day was when you read it. But you also remember ordinary people did extraordinary things.

Thank you to all those who serve, from the armed forces to the first responders.

Have empathy today. Tell people you love them. Be nice to one another, even if you disagree with their politics, and especially if you're unfamiliar with their background or where they're from.
