> It’s bittersweet and slightly nostalgic to see the theme come to an end. When I launched the Tavern in 2009, I regularly linked to tutorials and articles published by [Ian] Stewart. I’m almost certain Thematic and its creator helped out a number of budding theme developers between 2008-2011.

I feel the same way. When I first started hacking on WordPress themes, I started with Thematic. My final project in graduate school ended up being two child themes, built with Thematic. It introduced me to a lot of theming concepts and best practices. I'm glad it will live on in a fork. So long Thematic – thanks for all those hooks and filters!
