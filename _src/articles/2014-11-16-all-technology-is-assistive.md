Big Think has an interesting post on the topic of product design called, [All Technology is Assistive: Why Product Designers Need to Embrace Accessibility](http://bigthink.com/disruptive-demographics/50-shades-of-beige-can-we-build-accessible-products-places-that-are-exciting-too-2). It ask the question why assistive technology has to be in a separate category.
