> We become obsessed with tools and methods, very rarely looking at how these relate to the fundamental basics of web standards, accessibility and progressive enhancement. We obsess about a right way to do things as if there was one right way rather than looking at the goal; how things fit into the broader philosophy of what we do on the web and how what we write contributes to us being better at what we do.

Cole Henley in the [The Slow Web](http://cole007.net/blog/152/the-slow-web), talking about the rhythm of the web, and how and why we do what we do here.

It's a great read, and one that has me thinking more deeply about what I do each day.
