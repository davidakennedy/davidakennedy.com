Alex King [passed away last night](https://poststatus.com/alex-king/) after a long battle with cancer, leaving behind a wife, a daughter and many, many friends in the WordPress community. You can read the [community's thoughts and reaction on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=alexkingorg&src=typd).

I never met Alex, but I read his code and used his plugins. Because of him, I did things with my site I previously couldn't have done and became a better developer along the way. I suspect a lot of people in the WordPress feel that way today.
