I started January 1st like I have the past few New Year's days. I listened to David Foster Wallace's commencement address, _This is Water_. You can get it in [article form](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/20/fiction), [book form](https://www.amazon.com/This-Water-Delivered-Significant-Compassionate/dp/0316068225) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=this+is+water+david+foster+wallace) (blogged about it [in 2015](/blog/this-is-water/)).

I love its message. Pay attention, Be aware. Support others. Every day. Beyond that annual reminder, I'm thinking about what to focus on this year. I say that instead of goals because "focuses" last year helped me make substantial progress. I set one professional and one personal priority.

## Last Year

Professionally, I wanted to **be a better leader**. I'm happy with the efforts here. I started working with a [leadership coach](http://www.akshaykapur.net/), and it's made a huge difference for me. I'm more aware of how I want to operate as a leader, how I actually operate and how to cross the delta between the two. I have to keep growing of course, but I'm more mindful of the journey, not just the destination now.

Personally, I wanted to **read more**. I did that in a big way, reading 22 books. I spent a lot more time reading more consciously rather than thumbing through feeds. I've gone back to using a feed reader for articles on the web. My favorite read from 2018 was [Silence in the Age of Noise](https://www.amazon.com/Silence-Age-Noise-Erling-Kagge/dp/1524733237).

## This Year

The priorities I decided to aim at this year skew more toward objectives. They're broad, and I need to decide exactly how I'm going to work toward them, but having a direction versus no direction means I can start somewhere.

**Professional**: Thanks to a new professional growth focus at Automattic, all our designers wrote [mission statements](https://www.fastcompany.com/3026791/personal-mission-statements-of-5-famous-ceos-and-why-you-should-write-one-too). Mine is:

_David Kennedy works to make the web fast, accessible and beautiful. He brings empathy and persistence to tackle problems customers and colleagues face that block their path to the future_.

I'm looking forward to focusing on the craft of those areas, and helping others grow there too.

**Personal**: I want to find better balance in how I approach the things that require my attention and energy. I did a poor job of finding space from pressing matters in 2018. I let challenges consume me rather than me consuming the challenge. I read a [few](https://maketimebook.com/) [books](https://gregmckeown.com/book/) to help with that, and have one exercise (spending 30 minutes doing nothing) to help here. I want to make &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; a stronger habit so I can gain clarity faster.

Happy New Year! Let's do this.
