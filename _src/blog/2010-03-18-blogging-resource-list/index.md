You can never have enough resources when it comes to blogging.

I put this list together about three weeks ago for a presentation on WordPress.com vs. Blogger. The meat of the content was guided by this great post, comparing WordPress.com and Blogger.

However, I wanted to give people something more to guide their blogging adventures. That ignited this list of varied resources that I turn to every day when blogging.

Some contain advice, some lead to tools and some help you produce content. Become aquatinted with them, use them and your blogging will improve in no time.
