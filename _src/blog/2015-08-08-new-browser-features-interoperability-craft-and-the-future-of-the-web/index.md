Aaron Gustafson wrote a post about the [ongoing evolution of the web](http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/ramblings-on-new-browser-features-interoperability-craft-and-the-future-of-the-web/) that you should read.

It's easy to see the web as a unkempt, out-of-control beast. And it is in many ways, but that also gives it much beauty. Aaron reminds us of where we've been, what the web can do, what we can do and where we can go together.
