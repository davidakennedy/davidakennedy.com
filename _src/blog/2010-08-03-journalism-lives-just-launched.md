You may have noticed a [recent update I sent out via Twitter](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/status/20175541986).

[Steve Earley](http://stephencearley.com/) and I just launched a [new blog focused on how interactivity is helping and can help the news industry](http://journalismlives.com/its-alive-journalism-lives). Both Steve and I love blogging, have a deep passion for the future of the news and wanted to join the larger debate surrounding journalism's ongoing evolution, so starting this blog just made sense. We were lucky to have [quite a few supporters already](http://www.backtype.com/page/journalismlives.com%2Fits-alive-journalism-lives/conversations).

If you enjoy reading what I write here, I encourage you to check out [Journalism Lives](http://journalismlives.com/). Steve and I worked together really well during grad school at Elon, and have big plans and hopes for the site.

I'll also say this: even though Journalism Lives will focus on the news industry, I won't stop writing about it in this space. I plan to continue exploring multimedia journalism and other types of storytelling with technology here. Journalism isn't the only field facing a massive evolution, so the more we entertain problems and questions from anywhere and everywhere, the sooner we be able to craft innovative solutions and answers.

That's why I believe a blog like Journalism Lives can hold value for anyone interested in how people access online information. Our blog, like this one, is likely to draw inspiration from many different sources.

I hope you check it out and thanks for reading.
