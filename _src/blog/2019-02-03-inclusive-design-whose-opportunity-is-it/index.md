I wrote a summary of a talk I'm giving next week on Automattic Design's blog about how [inclusive design represents such an opportunity](https://automattic.design/2019/02/03/inclusive-design-whos-opportunity-is-it/) for every company and individual. Give it a read, and think about how your decisions can start impacting better design for everyone. It's easier than you think.
