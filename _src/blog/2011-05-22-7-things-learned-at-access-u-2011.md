Last week, I was lucky enough to attend [John Slatin Access U 2011](http://www.knowbility.org/v/accessu/). It was my first foray into learning more about accessibility beyond regular web standards.

It turned out to be one of the best professional experiences I've had. Here's what I learned:

1. Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought or addition to web design and development â€“ it should be part of it.
2. Accessibility isn't that hard, but there are always compromises to be made when it comes to a project's specs and its true needs.
3. Sometimes, even if you show big companies how important and easy accessibility is, they still don't get it.
4. The [basics](http://testacademic.stedwards.edu/accessible_html/index.php) will get you a long way.
5. Even with a few [small tweaks, WordPress can be made more accessible](http://slash25.com/2011/05/accessu-2011-accessibility-and-wordpress/).
6. There are a ton of myths floating around about javascript and accessibility. The big one that **IS FALSE**: if you want to be accessible, you can't use javascript.
7. You can be well on your way with accessibility testing thanks to a number of free testing tools.

## Did You Attend?

If so, let's collect the great resources that were shared at Access U. I started this [list of bookmarks on Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:davidakennedy/t:AccessU) that anyone can add to, so fee free to add stuff there.
