I love that the Medium Engineering team has written about [some of its accessibility mishaps](https://medium.com/medium-eng/five-goofy-things-medium-did-that-break-accessibility-3bc804ae818d). It's even better that they've fixed them, learned from the experience and shared it with the rest of the Web community.

If we want web accessibility to become easier, we all need to talk about it in a more open, honest way. Accessibility isn't just failure or success. The accessibility of your site or application doesn't have to be perfect, just a little better than before.
