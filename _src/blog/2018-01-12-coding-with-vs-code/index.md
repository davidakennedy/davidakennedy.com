I confess, I switched editors again. ðŸ™‚

I first heard about Visual Studio Code on the [Toolsday podcast](http://toolsday.io/episodes/vscode.html), but didn't give it much attention. I had recently started coding with [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), and was trying to embrace working with an IDE. Before giving it a go with PHPStorm, I enjoyed using both [Atom](/blog/atom-editor/) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com).

But a few weeks ago, I started using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) every day. I haven't looked back. Here's why:

- VS Code really does blend the best of both worlds: a code editor and IDE. I like how I have all the features of Atom and Sublime, with a dash of PHPStorm.
- My favorite feature so far? The built-in console. I love that I can do a lot of tasks in one app.
- It feels faster than Atom, and certainly less cumbersome than PHPStorm, my biggest criticisms of each of my last two editors.

I haven't run into many challenges in the switch because I tend to keep my editors lightweight, not using dozens of extensions. I have encountered some on and off issues with my PHP CodeSniffer and PHP executable configuration lately. I think it may be related to an existing bug in the extension though.

My current extensions include:

- [IntelliSense for CSS Class Names](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion)
- [PHP Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug)
- [PHP IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-intellisense)
- [phpcs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ikappas.phpcs)

We'll see if I run into any more challenges the more I use the editor.
