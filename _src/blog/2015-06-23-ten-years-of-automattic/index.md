> Our work is far from finished, and I hope there are hundreds of failures we learn from over the next 20 years. One of the things that makes me happiest is that I get to wake up every morning and work on the hard problem of making the web a better and more open place, and I do it alongside close to 400 talented people at Automattic and thousands in the broader community.

In [Ten Years of Automattic](http://ma.tt/2015/06/ten-years-of-automattic/), Matt Mullenweg talks about the first decade of the company he founded to help make the web a better place. I'm proud to be a small part of that journey, and can't wait to see where we go next.
