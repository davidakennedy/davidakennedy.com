I've tinkered with my site a lot over the past weekend to make it more IndieWeb-friendly.

What does that mean? You can learn more about the [IndieWeb movement](http://indiewebcamp.com/) on the site and read [about its principles](http://indiewebcamp.com/principles). Basically, you want:

- **Your content to be yours**
- **To be better connected to all services**
- **To control how things work**

These are novel concepts only because we've grown use to social networks and tech giants running the web. It doesn't have to be this way.

I've tackled a number of things on the [Getting Started page](http://indiewebcamp.com/Getting_Started) of IndieWeb Camp. I:

- Joined the IRC channel.
- Already had a personal domain and hosting. ðŸ™‚
- Set up web sign-in.
- Already had WordPress ready to go for content publishing. ðŸ™‚
- Installed a [link shortener plugin](http://willnorris.com/2011/01/hum-personal-url-shortener-wordpress).
- Started: Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere and automating it with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).
- Already had a WordPress theme that supported basic Microformats.
- Ported some photos from a photo blog to my own site.
- Set up webmentions and semantic-linkbacks via the [IndieWeb plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/). I'm pulling in mentions from Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus thanks to [Brid.gy](https://www.brid.gy/).
- Cleaned things up a bit by removing custom post types on the site, adding a new favicon and fixing a few bugs.

The [WordPress page](http://indiewebcamp.com/WordPress) was a great place to start.

Doing this wasn't that hard, especially after listening to a recent [talk on the IndieWeb by Tantek Ã‡elik](/blog/the-once-and-future-indieweb/). I don't know yet if I'll keep all this going as some of it may not suit my needs. This may just be an experiment, however, I do know one thing: I'm going to keep publishing on my own site.
