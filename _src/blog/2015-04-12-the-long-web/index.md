In [The Long Web](https://vimeo.com/118146193), Jeremy Keith talks about how with the web, we're building something greater than the [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria). But to do that well, we need to pay attention to the things that matter, like HTML, progressive enhancement, performance and URL structure. His message is simple: build your sites for the long haul. Make them last. It's something we don't think about enough in the rush to create the next thing on the web.
