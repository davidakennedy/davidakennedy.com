More than a month ago, I launched [Accessibility Weekly](http://a11yweekly.com) with the hope of making the field of web accessibility easier to learn and follow. I've had a blast watching the list steadily grow and receiving a handful of emails and tweets with positive feedback.

That said, I want to keep experimenting with Accessibility Weekly and hone in on one of the biggest reasons I started it in the first place. To give those new and/or interested in accessibility a way in.

So if you're a subscriber, expect some tweaks in format. The first thing I plan to do is expanding the "New to A11y" section, making it a short article or a series of links with a theme. Fear not though, I still plan to mix in valuable tips and links for veterans in the field.

## Newslettering vs. Blogging

What's it like writing a newsletter now that I have a few to my name? Like most writing: it's hard. Hard most days, really hard other days. I've relied on a handful of evergreen posts from this blog to help fill the gap when I don't have the energy to put something original together. I feel guilty about that, but I'd rather send something of value than something that's too rough around the edges. Granted, I don't have to put much original writing in Accessibility Weekly, but the curating of links takes time too. I see it as just as important as any original tip I share. I want to provide both knowledge and share other's knowledge. As the newsletter goes forward, I see it as an extension of my writing here. One fuels the other to fuel the other, so to speak.
