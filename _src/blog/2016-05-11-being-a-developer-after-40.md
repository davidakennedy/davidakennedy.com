Adrian Kosmaczewski has written a thoughtful post called, [Being a Developer After 40](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/being-a-developer-after-40-3c5dd112210c#.5p6p3nwr7), that you should read. He's filled it with great advice and reading material, laying out a plan for anyone to become a better developer. I love that most about this piece, that it's not about being good after a certain age, but getting good before then so you can thrive at any time in your career.
