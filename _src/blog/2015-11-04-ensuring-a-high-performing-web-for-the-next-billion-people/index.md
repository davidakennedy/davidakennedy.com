Bruce Lawson gave a keynote talk recently at Velocity Conference in Amsterdam called [Ensuring a High Performing Web for the Next Billion People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6As5HEkG5E) that you should watch. He's written a [blog post discussing the talk a bit](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2015/ensuring-a-high-performing-web-for-the-next-billion-people/) if you'd like more information.

It's fantastic because it touches on all the parts of the web that we know have nearly limitless potential, but that we haven't yet figured out how to do well consistently. These are things like performance, accessibility, progressive enhancement, embracing a multi-device world and more. We have much to do, so it's hard not to be excited about bringing the web to a truly global audience.
