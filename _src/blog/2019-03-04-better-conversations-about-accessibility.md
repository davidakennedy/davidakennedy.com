I published another post about accessibility over on the Automattic Design blog. This one focuses on why almost everyone can call themselves a designer, and how to have [better conversations around design and accessibility](https://automattic.design/2019/03/04/better-conversations-about-accessibility/).

My favorite piece of advice from the piece: **design with them** (whomever needed). Too often, accessibility gets hard because it's viewed as an immovable obstacle, but it's just another design constraint. Embrace it.
