> I try not to have heroes these days, but instead admire actions.

I shared this with a colleague recently who said it resonated with them. It grew out of a conversation where I quoted a well-known creative celebrity, and my colleague rightfully pointed out how that creative had their own failings. When we hold people up, it's important to see the whole picture. That's why I like actions. Over time, heroes can prove fallible. The right actions, however, can become more worthy over time.
