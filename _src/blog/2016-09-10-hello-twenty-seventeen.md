After years of contributing to WordPress and its default themes, I get to help lead one â€“ [Twenty Seventeen](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/09/say-hello-to-twenty-seventeen-%F0%9F%91%8B%F0%9F%8F%BD/)! To say I'm excited and honored would be _the_ understatement of both 2016 and 2017. ðŸ™‚

I'm looking forward to bringing a new theme to WordPress, and with the help of the WordPress community, making it the best it can be. I'll be working with [Mel Choyce](https://choycedesign.com), who designed Twenty Seventeen, and [Laurel Fulford](http://www.laurelfulford.com), who will help me give the theme life. Sure, Mel has designed some of the most beautiful themes out there and Laurel can code up anything, but that's not what has me the most excited.

What I love most about open source, and the WordPress community, is the people. All artful creations carry inspiration from other sources, and I believe you can't create anything worthwhile alone. That's why Twenty Seventeen [needs all the help it can get](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/09/twenty-seventeen-kickoff-meeting-notes/) from as many people as possible.

If you've ever wanted to find a way to contribute WordPress, to take part in something that millions of people will touch every day, now is the time. Drop a comment on this post if you [want to help](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/09/twenty-seventeen-kickoff-meeting-notes/). Let's do this!
