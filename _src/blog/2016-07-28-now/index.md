I stumbled across a cool project about [now pages](http://nownownow.com), thanks to checking out [Melanie Richards' site](http://melanie-richards.com/now/). You focus the content around one conversation starter:

> Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

I dig the idea so I made [my own](/now/), converting an old reading list page that I hardly used.

I'm aiming to check on it once a month and update it as necessary. It fits in nicely with the [minimalist living](/blog/minimalist-living-starting-now/) I've strived for in the last year or so.
