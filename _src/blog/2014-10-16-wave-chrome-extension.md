Recently, WebAIM [announced it would release a Chrome extension version of Wave](http://webaim.org/blog/webaims-15th-bday/), its popular web accessibility testing tool. Wave has a popular [Firefox add-on](http://wave.webaim.org/toolbar/) and [web version](http://wave.webaim.org), both tools that have always proved indispensable in my accessibility testing.

Plus, WebAIM is also celebrating its 15th birthday! ðŸ™‚ I'm excited to see what happens with the Chrome extension, especially since Chrome is my primary development browser.
