Today, the idea of [responsive web design turns five](http://aneventapart.com/news/post/five-years-ago-today-responsive-web-designs-debut). An Event Apart posted about the anniversary of Ethan Marcotte's [talk in Seattle in 2010 where he first proposed the idea](http://aneventapart.com/news/post/ethan-marcotte-a-dao-of-flexibility-video).

I listened to the talk today, which I hadn't heard before. I remember first reading the [canonical A List Apart article on the subject](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) at my job when I first jumped into web work. My first thought? "I have to make this happen on our site." As the anniversary post points out:

> After that day, nothing in web design or development would ever be the same.
