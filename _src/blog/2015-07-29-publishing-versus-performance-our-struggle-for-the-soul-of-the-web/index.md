Jeffrey Zeldman talks about the [struggle for the soul of the web](http://www.zeldman.com/2015/07/29/publishing-versus-performance-our-struggle-for-the-soul-of-the-web/), brought forth by the [The Mobile Web Sucks](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks) on The Verge. It's worth a read as is Jeremy Keith's related [On the Verge](https://adactio.com/journal/9312) piece. To strike a balance between wonderful content and performance, like most things worth doing, we need more cooperation, experimentation, failure and patience.
