> "Today, the critical skills of a web professional aren't technical. They're skills like advocacy, facilitation, diplomacy, pragmatism, and patience. Technical skills still matter, but they don't differentiate us in the market anymore, and we can't use them effectively without tackling organizational change. To be effective, we need to leave our comfort zones."
