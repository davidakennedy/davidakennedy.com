I missed my annual birthday post â€“ I must be getting old. ðŸ™‚

I had a great birthday â€“ a fun taco and beer dinner at [Crafted: The Art of the Taco](http://www.eatatcrafted.com/crafted-taco/). For the record, it was March 2nd.

I spent most of the last year looking at houses. No lie! We bought one in Greensboro, and have been improving it ever since. I'm excited to make it our own, [little by little](/blog/the-story-of-one-new-bathroom-fan/). I do wish I could start over on the bathrooms from scratch though. But like I said, little by little.

At work, I've been tackling leadership roles more, being in that role with [Twenty Seventeen](/blog/dear-twenty-seventeen-contributors/) and Components. I'm enjoying stretching myself there.

Beyond that, I'm writing and reading more, two habits I think will help me grow more than anything else. I've also started getting deeper into minimalism, questioning my purchase decisions with thoughtfulness and looking to live more with less.

I also began a simple bodyweight workout regimen for ten to fifteen minutes, five days a week. I've been at it for more than two months, so it feels good to have it sticking as a habit. I'm feeling better physically, and enjoying the fact that everything I'm doing can be done without a trip to the gym or lots of equipment.

I'm looking forward to a more focused year. We'll see how it goes!
