I've played a ton of [Sim City](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity) through its various iterations, and like many, I disliked the latest game in the series. I was excited to see newcomer to the city builder genre, Cities: Skylines, receive lots of positive press. I needed my city fix, and I'm enjoying it a lot so far! It stays true to a city builder's roots, but adds its own flair in spots.

For tips on the ins and ots of strategic, but fun city building in Skyline, I recommend watching Skye Storme's YouTube channel. Check out his playlist, [Cities: Skylines – Building Manhattan – Gameplay/Tips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbCLzFKeiWkPKe53RM24qh1vzhn9PBXuf), for everything you need to know about the intricacies of this new city builder.
