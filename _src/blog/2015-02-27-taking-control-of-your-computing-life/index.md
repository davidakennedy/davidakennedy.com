I'm not saying goodbye to Apple, Google and Microsoft or anything like that, but journalist Dan Gillmor says he's [putting more trust in communities than corporations](https://medium.com/backchannel/why-i-m-saying-goodbye-to-apple-google-and-microsoft-78af12071bd).

He makes a compelling case, and it's one I've given thought to before. Before I bought my latest 11-inch Macbook Air late last year, I looked at Linux laptops. I seriously considered one. But I'll admit my fear of missing conveniences got me. I work on the web, and even though the Macbook Air isn't my primary machine, I still might need it. I can't imagine doing my job as a front end developer without all the necessary tools. Maybe I'm wrong?

But like Dan, I'm keeping my eye on that space, hoping solutions continue to evolve and make control as easy as the conveniences we crave.
