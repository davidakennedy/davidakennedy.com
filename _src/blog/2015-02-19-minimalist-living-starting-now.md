I started this year with [simpler goals than in years past](/blog/2015/). Watching a [documentary on the cost of human progress](/blog/surviving-progress-documentary/) a few days ago has made me want to simplify even more. So I'm taking some of the advice in [this post on Zen Habits about simple living](http://zenhabits.net/simple-living-manifesto-72-ideas-to-simplify-your-life/).

I've already made a list of my most important four to five priorities in life, created a simple to-do list system with Reminders, and knocked off 50-plus blogs from my WordPress.com Reader. Next up? My desk and workspace. Here's to hoping that doesn't take most of the weekend. ðŸ™‚
