Clark Scheffy wrote an [insightful post about how he evolved into a better leader](https://medium.com/ideo-stories/be-the-leader-you-wish-you-had-be5df20f915e). My favorite quote:

> This is about what I learned the hard way: That great creative leadership is about letting go of that nagging mental image you have of what you are supposed to do. Itâ€™s about believing in others, and focusing on fanning the flames of creative, weird, exothermic people, rather than on fixing problems.

I like the message on perspective. It's all about your perspective.
