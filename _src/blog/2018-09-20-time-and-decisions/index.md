Seth Godin has written a lot of classic posts, but this [one is my favorite](https://seths.blog/2018/07/the-timedecision-gap/). He talks about how time and decisions become interlinked. He says:

> Butâ€¦
> That's our work.
> We don't make stuff as much as we make decisions.
> <cite>Seth Godin</cite>

As a leader, I do this every day. I used to produce code, but now I produce decisions. If it's a good day, I make clarity. That clarity often comes if I put the right amount of time into the needed problem. If I don't, I start to lose momentum and the clarity becomes more elusive.
