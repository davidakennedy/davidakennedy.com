Morten Rand-Hendriksen gave an excellent talk at WordCamp Europe 2016 about the role of empathy in the web field. It's called [Empathy and Acceptance in Design and Community](http://wordpress.tv/2016/06/29/morten-rand-hendriksen-empathy-and-acceptance-in-design-and-community/), and you should give it a listen. I didn't catch it in person, but it's one of the best talks I've heard in awhile. I believe practicing empathy in our work _could_ have the same impact on the web as responsive design. It could be transformative.
