One video game artist, Bryan Shannon found a new way to make a living in video games â€“ using one of my favorite, new games:

> Right now, 233 members of the _Cities: Skylines_ community are paying him to create new content for the game, to the tune of $735 per building created. He's not working for a developer, and he's not working for himself; instead, he's working for a small subset of devoted _Cities: Skylines_ players that want to share his work with the world.

Check out [How a _Cities: Skylines_ modder turned community generosity into a full-time job](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/how-a-cities-skylines-modder-turned-community-generosity-into-a-full-time-job/) for the full story. I haven't tried out any of the modding portions of _Cities_ yet, but I imagine I will once my city becomes larger. I could see modding as adding the final touches to a masterpiece or as a way to show your personal style.
