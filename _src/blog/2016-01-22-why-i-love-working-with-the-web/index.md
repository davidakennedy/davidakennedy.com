Remy Sharp has a nice post on his blog about his [love for working on the web](https://remysharp.com/2016/01/20/why-i-love-working-with-the-web). It's worth a read, and maybe even a response on your own site.

He refers to Douglas Crockford's famous quote:

> The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.

And says:

> This hostile environment is what gets me excited. That challenge of getting my page to render everywhere. Getting the code just right so that it progressively enhances so that everyone can view the page.

That is also what excites me about working on the web. Our work here, in this medium, is ephemeral. It will carry little meaning decades from now, at least at the technical level. Better, more advanced work will eclipse it. That's okay. My work on the web – our work – will last because it's open. People will learn from it, and carry that knowledge forward into their own endeavors, whether they work on the web or not.

The Web represents this giant book that we're all writing and learning from. Who wouldn't get excited about that?
