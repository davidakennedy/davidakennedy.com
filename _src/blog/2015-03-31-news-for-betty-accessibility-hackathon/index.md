Today, I participated in an [accessibility hackathon](http://18f.github.io/hackathons/a11yhack/) run by [White House Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp), [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), the [National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html), and [DC Legal Hackers](http://dclegalhackers.org/). The day was packed with demos, discussion and coding on all sorts of projects, ranging from solving the lack of alt attributes on Twitter images to a more efficient way to integrate Section 508 into the government procurement process.

We didn't solve everything in one day, but we had [lots of ideas](https://hackpad.com/Accessibility-Hackathon-a11yhack-FSW5lFX53LP#:h=Problem-Statements), worked together and did it in the open. I contributed to a new, in-progress web app called [News for Betty](http://newsforbetty.com/). It's a news aggregator that takes the home pages of major news sources and cuts out the cruft, making it easier for people of all abilities get to the news faster. A fun project for a former journalist! You can [check it out on Github](https://github.com/tagawa/newsforbetty). A handful of my pull requests centered on improving its accessibility have [already been merged](https://github.com/tagawa/newsforbetty/graphs/contributors).

It's easy to jump into any problem thinking you need to bring a new solution. With a newer, but established project like News for Betty, the creators had already formed a solid base to an existing problem. Sometimes you just need to give something support, a nudge in a new direction or a different way of thinking, and maybe a few pull requests. ðŸ™‚

This is especially true on the web where thousands of worthy projects need more accessibility attention. What have you helped today?
