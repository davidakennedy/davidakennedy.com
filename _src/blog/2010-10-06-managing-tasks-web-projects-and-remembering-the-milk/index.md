I can't remember the last time I forgot the milk, but I do remember the last time I neglected to attend to something on my to-do list.

Enter the web tool, [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/), an online task management system. [Kevin Loker](http://twitter.com/kevinloker) and [Aram Zucker-Scharff,](http://twitter.com/Chronotope) two people I follow on Twitter, recommended the tool after I asked. I needed something that would help manage both small and large scale web projects. I looked at [Todoist](http://todoist.com/), [Google Tasks](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/) and Tasks within Microsoft Outlook. Remember the Milk seemed to be the most user friendly and flexible. It also helped that friends recommended it.

## How I'm Using It

I created different to-do lists that correspond with folders in my email. The email folders contain the action items that I need to make web updates, like copy, photos and other information. So far, this has created a streamlined approach that works for me. Keep in mind, I'm not sharing my lists with anyone, and I have it set up as more of an individual task manager tool.

## What I Like

- Its interface is simple and easy to use.
- The lists load quickly.
- The keyboard shortcuts make many things within the program faster.
- It's free.

## What About You?

How do you manage your task lists? Are there other free tools out there that enable collaboration, and are geared toward web projects?
