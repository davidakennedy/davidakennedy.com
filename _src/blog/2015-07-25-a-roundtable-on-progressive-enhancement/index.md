A week or so ago, I listened to a [great discussion about progressive enhancement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDNKs_6ptss) from the Edge Conference. It touches on a number of topics that have popped up in the JavaScript community lately, like baselines and isomorphic JavaScript, and is definitely worth a listen. Related: Jeremy Keith on [establishing a baseline](https://adactio.com/journal/9206).
