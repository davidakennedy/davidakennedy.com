I wrote about [how accessibility design reviews can make a difference in your design process](https://adhoc.team/2023/02/22/the-importance-of-adding-accessibility-design-reviews-to-the-design-process/) on the Ad Hoc blog. I wanted to create a post like this because I didn't find anything like it to cite when talking to other designers about what they should look for in an accessibility design review.
