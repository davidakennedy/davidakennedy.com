This past week, while at Automattic's annual Grand Meetup, I completed the most difficult hike I've ever done. Myself and a small group of Automattician's hiked up [Skywalk Trail on Rainbow Mountain](http://localwhistler.com/news/2015/08/17/skywalk-trail/) – a challenging hike full of amazing views. It's near Whistler, British Columbia in Canada.

I say difficult because about an hour into the hike, I wasn't sure I would make it. I huffed and puffed up a few steep hills and had to take a lot of short breaks. But I pushed through and enjoyed the best payoff – the views (see the photos!). I felt it the next few days with sore calves and quads.

A big thanks to [Joe Boydston](https://crazyrunningguy.com) for organizing the hike, [Stu West](https://stuwest.org) for hiking back down with me, and the rest of the group for being such great company.
