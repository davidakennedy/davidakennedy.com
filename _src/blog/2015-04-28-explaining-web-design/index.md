Since transitioning away from journalism and writing to working on the web some six-plus years ago, I've struggled explaining to my family what I do.

Sure, there's the go-to: _I make websites_. Or: _I help people publish online_. _I help people tell their stories on the web_. That's my favorite.

When I explained to my mom what Automattic did when I joined, and the mission behind WordPress, she started to see why I shifted my lifelong ambition of writing words to writing code. But I never really shifted. I'm still making. Now, I'm making the web, and it's messy. It can't be clearly defined on most days and damn, it's so fluid.

I guess I just make the web with the rest of you. And I love it.
