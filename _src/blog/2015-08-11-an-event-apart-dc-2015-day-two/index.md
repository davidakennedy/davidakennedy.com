Day two of [An Event Apart DC 2015](http://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2015) kicked off with Brad Frost introducing us to a different way to create the pieces that make up the sites we build. As he went on, and speakers took the stage after him, I started to notice an overarching message forming from these separate presentations.

We need to challenge our assumptions. Whether it was Aaron Gustafson teaching us that we can love forms instead of hate them, Derek Featherstone taking us outside of the device "box" we have lived in or Eric Meyer reminding us that not all users are the ideal userâ€¦ You get the idea.

We sometimes get caught up in the way we do things because of stale processes, tools we've used for too long or forgetting that the simplest approach to getting started works the best. Many of the presenters echoed ideas similar to this. I left the conference having that typical conference overload. So many new ideas floating around, I wasn't sure where to start. But that's my old assumption kicking in. It says I should master something before trying it in a project. But that's not the right approach here. I just need to open the sketch pad or fire up a CodePen and start experimenting.
