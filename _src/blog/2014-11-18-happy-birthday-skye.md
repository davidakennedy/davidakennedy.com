My daughter, Skye, turned six-months-old yesterday! It feels like I held her for the first time in the hospital just yesterday.

I love watching her grow in all the millions of ways she does each day. Notable recent milestones include having her first two teeth come in, discovering her toes and trying to stand even though she doesn't have sitting or crawling down yet. ðŸ˜€

The best part of being a dad so far? Discovering she has shaped me way more than I have her at this point. I think I expected that but not to this degree.

I can't wait to see what she does next!
