Version 1.1 of [Accessible Zen](http://wordpress.org/themes/accessible-zen) hit the WordPress theme directory today. [Download it now](http://wordpress.org/themes/accessible-zen)! ðŸ™‚

I added one new feature, improved one area and fixed a number of bugs for this release.

## The New Feature

I've added [contextual help](http://ottopress.com/2011/new-in-wordpress-3-3-more-useful-help-screens/) to the Themes page in the WordPress Dashboard. It gives theme users a bit more information about the Accessible Zen inline with their experience.

## The Big Addition

Accessible Zen now sports the [accessibility-ready tag](http://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready). Users can find themes that keep accessibility in mind from the start via that tag. They all follow [specific accessibility guidelines](http://make.wordpress.org/themes/guidelines/guidelines-accessibility/) for themes in the directory. Accessible Zen has always followed these guidelines since its launch, and now has added the tag since it went live on WordPress.org a few weeks ago.

## Customizer Improvements

I've set better default options for the few of Accessible Zen's Customizer theme options, which should make for a better experience upon theme activation. **Note: This may cause users to have to set their options again via the Customizer**.

You can read about all the updates below.

### Changelog for 1.1
