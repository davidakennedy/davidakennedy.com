I listened to this Web Ahead episode today about the [everyday developer](http://thewebahead.net/104), and it resonated with me. I imagine many developers would identify with it because it hits on the fact that the tool chain for building websites has become increasingly complex. It's getting harder and harder to "get started" with the web. Any developer can become overwhelmed by what to learn next. That said, many seasoned Web workers know two of the main messages that Jen Simmons and Rachel Andrew talk about to combat the feelings of overload:

1. Tools are just tools, not the raw material â€“ the building blocks.
2. Know how to teach yourself new skills.

Those are good messages to keep pinned to the top your text notes and read the next time you want to open that new shiny thing.
