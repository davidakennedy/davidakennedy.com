I knew [The Setup](http://usesthis.com) existed, but in the last few days I enjoyed pouring over a number of the interviews. I thought it would be fun to write my own, and update it every year or so to see how it changes.

## Who are you, and what do you do?

Hey there! I'm David Kennedy (DK, for short), and I'm a Theminator for [Automattic](http://automattic.com). I wrangle themes for [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/), making them the best they can be and ensuring everyone can find a theme they love. Iâ€™m an accessibility evangelist who loves the open web and open source code. Before writing code, I use to write words as a journalist.

## What hardware do you use?

I'm writing this on a 2014 11-inch Macbook Air. I also have a 2014 15-inch Macbook Pro for work, a iPad Air and a custom-built PC for gaming. I carry an iPhone 5 with me everywhere. I tend to keep computers for about fours to five years, so I'm glad I love the 11-inch Air.

## And what software?

I've simplified a lot in the last six months or so. No matter what device I'm on, I have [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com) running to keep notes, lists and drafts of writing. I've also started to use Apple Reminders and Calendar a lot more. Coupled with Mail, everything just works.

On my personal machine, iPad and iPhone I use Safari to browse the web. I use LastPass to save my passwords and [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) to save bookmarks. I don't have much software on my personal machine beyond the stock applications. I do have [Atom](http://atom.io) and [Libre Office](http://www.libreoffice.org) for editing documents. I have [Skype](http://skype.com), [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com) and [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/) for the occasional communications need. I blog using WordPress, specifically WordPress.com. I'm currently on a 56-day writing streak.

When working on front end development, I use a mix of all the big browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Chrome wins as my most-used. I like [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com) for my command-line editing, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) for my local environments, Atom for my text editing and [Cyber Duck](https://cyberduck.io) for any FTP needs. At Automattic, we use [Slack](http://slack.com) for communication, and a smattering of Gmail. Among the browser extensions and add-ons I use for Chrome and Firefox on a regular basis, these I cannot live without: [Wave](http://wave.webaim.org), [Accessibility Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb), [Color Extractor Bookmarklet](http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-extractor/), [Color Contrast Analyzer for Chrome](http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast-chrome/), [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/) and [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/). I also dig these color tools: [Color Palette Accessibility Checker](http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast/), [Tanaguru Contrast-Finder](http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/) and [Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA)](http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser). Yes, I am a color contrast nerd. I also use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) a lot. I usually do most of my web development in Chrome, most of my accessibility testing in Firefox and lots of screen reader testing in Safari and Voiceover.

## What would be your dream setup?

I bought my 11-inch Macbook Air less than six months ago, but I seriously considered getting something with a flavor of Linux on it. The thought of having a more "free" machine entices me. I looked at a few machines, but [couldn't get over the hump](/blog/taking-control-of-your-computing-life/) of not having everything tied together in one ecosystem via Apple. So I'd love an open machine that does that just as well. Oh, and less software. Why do I need all this? ðŸ™‚
