A few months ago I announced I would [create an accessible WordPress theme](/blog/what-do-you-need-in-an-accessible-wordpress-theme/). I was surprised by the interest it generated in the comments in the post and on Twitter. All of it excited me a lot!

Since then I've made a bit of progress. I've gotten my base theme files in shape and ready â€“ I'll be starting with [Underscores](http://underscores.me) as my base. Shortly after that, [Joseph Karr O'Connor](http://accessiblejoe.com/) contacted me about his newly created [Cities project](http://accessiblejoe.com/cities/). In short, a group of developers and designers will produce a collection of accessible WordPress themes.

It didn't take long for me to say yes and jump onto the project. It would have been fun to create something on my own, but to collaborate with part of the accessibility community, be a part of a larger project and produce something truly open source is exciting.

We're in the beginning stages of it all, assembling teams and deciding on the goals of the themes. Stay tuned for more as the project develops.

<mark>If you want to be a part of the project, <a href="mailto:me@davidakennedy.com">email me</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy">contact me on Twitter</a>. I'm looking for a designer for my team.</mark>
