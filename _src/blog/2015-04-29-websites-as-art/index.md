I [make the web](/blog/explaining-web-design/) with a lot of different people each day. We push pixels and stress over things like the experience and the performance, but most of that lives in the here and now. Websites evolve. Links break, designs change. Sites go offline.

People can visit what I make now, but how long will it last? Most web design has a shelf-life. Does it make an impression? Will that last? Web design alone won't last or make a strong impression. Pair that with people's content, their blog posts, the stories and life's work they share â€“ that _will_ last. Hopefully, whatever I'm doing gets out of the way of that.

Because I just provide a frame and canvas for the artwork.
