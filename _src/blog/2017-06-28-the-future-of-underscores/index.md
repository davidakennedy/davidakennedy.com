A few days ago, I published a post on ThemeShaper [about the future of Underscores](https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/). I loved seeing [coverage on WP Tavern about it](https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-renew-efforts-on-underscores-retire-components-starter-theme-generator), and even better, I [went on the WordPress Weekly podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YZIXxSBIlo) to talk about it, and the future of theming.

**Related**: Underscores was my first [open source code contribution](/blog/issue-no-300/), so I'm as excited as anyone to see it continue to be something the WordPress community relies on. ðŸ™‚

**Update**: I wrote some more about [retiring products, specifically Components](https://a8cdesignflow.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/how-to-know-when-to-walk-away-from-a-project/).
