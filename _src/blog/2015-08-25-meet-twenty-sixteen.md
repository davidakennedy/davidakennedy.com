Today, [Tammie Lister](https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed) [introduced Twenty Sixteen](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/), the next default theme for WordPress, to the world. It's designed by the [Takashi Irie](https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi), who also created Twenty Fourteen and Twenty Fifteen. In his own words:

> Twenty Sixteen is a modernised approach of an ever-popular layout â€” a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.

If you want to get involved, make sure you're following the [Make WordPress Core blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/), and check out the meeting times for Twenty Sixteen.
