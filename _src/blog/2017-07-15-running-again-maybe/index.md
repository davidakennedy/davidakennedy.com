I used to [be a runner](/blog/501-mile/).

That was in high school – a long time ago. I tried many times to start running again, but it never stuck. I realized in college that what I missed most about running was the team I ran with. I couldn't replicate that though, despite running in groups and trying different programs. Lately though, I'm back at it, and feeling more enthused about running than I have in years. My secret? Low expectations!

That sounds lame, but here's what I mean. In the past, I've had my eye what's next in my running program, not what I'm doing now. So if I was running during my first week, I was thinking about next week, where I should be and how I should get there. Instead of just enjoying a run or two. Now, I'm focused on how I feel, my form and getting to know running again.

Granted, Ive only been running for a week, mixed in with the bodyweight strength training program I've done since the beginning of the year. But it feels fun again for the first time in a long time. Two things that have helped are the book [Running for Health and Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Running-Health-Happiness-Beginners-Pain-Free-ebook/dp/B014ECP932/) by Jason Fitzgerald, and his companion blog [Strength Running](http://strengthrunning.com). The advice has been simple and practical – just what I need.

I'm looking forward to seeing how things develop in the next few weeks when I have my running shoes on.
