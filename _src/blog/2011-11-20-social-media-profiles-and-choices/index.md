The [social media world has become more crowded](/blog/social-networking-and-competition/) than ever. The battle for users has heated up as Facebook and Google roll out new feature after new feature. Watching this has made me wonder how many people will hit social media fatigue.

Most people can only handle two or three profiles. As the landscape becomes more crowded and competitive, I like to think about the question of choice. Which social media platform would I choose if I had to pick just one?

A few moths ago, I would have picked [Twitter](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy). It's quick, has a nice user interface and has given me a lot of personal and professional value. Lately though, I've found more value in [Google Plus](http://plus.google.com/u/0/116559233611854402184/). The profiles have more options, you can still use hash tags and the conversations flow easier.

Google Plus is my pick. What's yours?
