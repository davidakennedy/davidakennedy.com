I like to explore. I get excited about new places and things. I can't help it.

Sometimes it gets me in trouble. Like the first time I traveled to Washington, D.C. I parked in a parking garage, got excited about my new surroundings and failed to notice the address of the garage. Hours later, I couldn't remember the exact location amid a handful of parking garages in the area. Silly directionally-challenged me.

I recently let the same thing happen with social media. I got distracted. While studying interactive media in graduate school, I dove into all kinds of social media sites. Some I found more useful than others, so some profiles lingered untouched. I thought I needed to keep all of them alive and around. Silly directionally-challenged me.

So I reevaluated the social media tools I used and the approach I took. Here's what I did.

## Less is More

- [StumbleUpon](http://stumbleupon.com/): Gone. I enjoyed the spontaneity of this social discovery and bookmarking site, but to me, it overlapped some of what I found on Twitter and Delicious.
- [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/): Gone. I like Vimeo's interface much more than [YouTube's](http://youtube.com), but I stuck with YouTube because I've been there longer.
- [Google Buzz](http://www.google.com/buzz): Gone. I simply turned off my Buzz account, but did not delete. I'm curious to see what will happen with the [much-rumored Google Me](http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-20009159-265.html), and how that will effect Buzz.
- [Delicious](http://delicious.com/): Replaced. I joined [Diigo](http://diigo.com/user/davidakennedy) because it has more options, like sticky notes and page captures.
- [Flickr](http://flickr.com/): Replaced. Now, have a simple [photo blog](http://davidakennedy.wordpress.com) on [Posterous](http://posterous.com/) in place of Flickr. Although I love Flickr, I never used it that much, and the blogging style fits me better.
- I also kept profiles on the current standbys: [Facebook](http://facebook.com/davidakennedy) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidakennedy).

So now I'm a firm believer in less is more. I can focus more on the services I enjoy more, like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy/), and giving more attention to my [running blog](http://www.gutcheckrunning.com/) on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/). However, I would say to each his own. You have to find the right combination that suits you and your interests.

## Tips for Organization

My advice?

1. Use the networks you actually enjoy and/or are important to your profession.
2. Keep your main profiles to a minimum of three to five. Have another two or three that you experiment with.
3. Constantly [evaluate](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/30/if-you%E2%80%99ve-got-social-media-fatigue-ur-doin-it-wrong/). Are you using your profiles? Are you getting value? Are you giving value?

I certainly still leave room for exploration. I'm trying the new [Digg](http://digg.com/davidakennedy), although I never used the older version much, and [Cliqset](http://cliqset.com/davidakennedy) stands alone as one of my favorite, lesser-known social networks and tools. So I still explore, except now it's easier to remember where I parked.
