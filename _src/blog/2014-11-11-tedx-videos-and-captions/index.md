Haben Girma, a lawyer and disability rights advocate, gave a great talk at TEDx Baltimore about [disabilities and the power of access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvoj-ku8zk0). In it, she told the story of her college days and eating at the cafeteria. As a deaf-blind student, she had to push for the staff to send her the menus ahead of time so she could know what to eat. Her quote sums up how transforming access can be:

> When they remembered to send the menus, life was delicious.

The Daily Beast has a [piece about her work](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/05/tedx-talks-have-a-disability-problem-but-this-incredible-young-woman-is-working-to-change-that.html), including the drive to get TED and TEDx to caption more its videos.
