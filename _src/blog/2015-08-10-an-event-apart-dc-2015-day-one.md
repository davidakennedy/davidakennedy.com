Today, I attended [An Event Apart DC 2015](http://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2015), and loved how each talk touched on another, but yet little overlapped happened. I'm not one to write detailed posts about each talk because conferences help me expand my thinking, not show me exactly how to do something. They introduce me to topics, and point me in exciting directions. It's still up to me to go in those directions though.

So what were they for day one? These are just a few of the points that stayed with me.

Jeffrey Zeldman encouraged us to get our ideas out there, newly formed or experimental. In code, sketch or blog post. Sarah Parmenter showed us data that the Web is more social than you think, but not like you think. Yesenia Perez-Cruz talked about how performance makes for good design. Jen Simmons brought us back to the world of funky magazine design layouts, and convinced us it much of it can be done with CSS â€” now. And Cassie McDaniel and Cameron Moll touched on the details of user experience and how they can serve as the connective tissue in your projects.

None of this is new, per se. But it _is_ new when stacked next to where we've been as an industry and where we need to go. Each speaker provided that as a backdrop or touch point, so what is old is new and amplified. I'm excited to process it all a bit more and think about how I can bring it to my everyday work.
