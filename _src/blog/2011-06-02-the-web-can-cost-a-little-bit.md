Free services litter the web. The web is built on &#8220;free&#8221; after all.

Gmail, Facebook, Twitter and the like all give services away, supplementing it with advertising and account upgrades. That's called [freemium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium). I use to be totally opposed to paying for things like that. Friends upgraded their [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) accounts. Not me. I switched to [Posterous](http://posterous.com/).

Lately, my thinking has shifted. I laid down the paltry amount of $25 a year for an upgraded account to [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/), an online task management app and site. The upgrade gave me the site's sweet Andriod app. Just yesterday I paid $9 to open an account on [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/), an online bookmarking service. Sure, Delicious is still viable, but I grew tired of it long ago. I tried Google Bookmarks, but missed RSS feeds and the public nature of bookmarking. Thanks to a [post by Andrew Spittle](http://andrewspittle.net/2011/05/27/remembrance-of-links-past/), I discovered Pinboard.

I love both these services. Does that tell you that you get what you pay for? Probably not. I just think it means I, and others, are willing to pay a little extra for an efficient and beautiful experience in our web tools.
