Tim Kadlec gave a powerful, recent talk called [Focusing on What Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61MuwOtZBOE) that you should watch. It touches on the three areas of the web that we web workers often overlook or neglect: accessibility, performance and security. Yet, those end up being the factors that have the most impact on the people using our products and services. We have the ability to unlock the web for everyone â€“ if we focus on the right things.
