I penned my first blog post today for the [Ad Hoc blog](https://adhoc.team/blog/index.html). It's on a topic that comes up all the time in my accessibility work: [When to manage focus in an accessible way](https://adhoc.team/2021/09/09/when-to-manage-focus-in-an-accessible-way/).

If you’ve ever read through a long article and lost your place on the page, you know how frustrating it can be to find your place again while trying to remember what you were reading about. A similar experience happens on the web if you don’t properly manage focus for people who rely on the keyboard or screen readers to navigate websites.

Check out the post to learn the when and why of focus management.
