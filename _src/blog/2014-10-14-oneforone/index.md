Finding people who truly inspire you can be hard these days. Much less, _real_ people who you might meet in your field that come from diverse backgrounds.

That may get easier. ðŸ™‚

Oneforone is a game where you pick an inspiring hotshot in your field to add to a list, but people can see who you've selected and the whole idea is to pick people from underrepresented groups. Created by [Deanna Zandt](https://twitter.com/Deanna), [Melissa Pierce](https://twitter.com/melissapierce) and [Andrew Rasiej](https://twitter.com/Rasiej), the Tech Lady Mafia has a version of the game going for [Ada Lovelace Day](http://findingada.com/) (hint: that's today!).

Who would you add? I [added someone](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/pull/15) who I worked with at The Arc that inspires me.

You can add a name by [forking the repo](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone) and editing the `names.yml` file, or by [submitting an issue on the repo](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/issues).

You can read [more about the nexus of the game here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2012/07/09/a-challenge-to-digital-influencers-join-the-one4one-game/). I bet this list will be one to watch!
