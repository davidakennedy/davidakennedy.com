Nonprofits have a lot of choices when it comes to content management systems.

There's [Blackbaud NetCommunity](http://www.blackbaud.com/products/internet/netcommunity.aspx), [Convio](http://www.convio.com/our-products/cms.html), (the first two are not open source) [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/), [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and moreâ€¦ It's easy to become overwhelmed by those choices. Many of these systems have similarities, and often the right choice comes down to the individual needs of each specific nonprofit, and its technical capacity. All that aside, let's take a look at why WordPress stands alone as **THE** open-source CMS choice for nonprofits:

## The WordPress Difference

1. Easy: WordPress is easy to use, from both a user standpoint and a development standpoint. And hey, plenty of nonprofits have [found success using WordPress](http://wordpress.org/showcase/tag/non-profit/).
2. Open-Source: WordPress is a true open-source project. It's powered by thousands of people, and that leads to [quick development cycles](http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/version-3-2-project-schedule/) and innovation.
3. Flexible: Built with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL, WordPress grows with the web. And you can [do just about anything](http://wordpress.org/showcase/) with it.
4. Tips, Tutorials and Guidance Galore: WordPress, like any other CMS, can be intimidating when you first dive in. However, once you start cruising the interwebz, you notice plenty of [support](http://wordpress.org/support/) and places to turn to [learn more about WordPress](/blog/31-resources-for-powering-a-website-with-wordpress/).
5. True Community: The more I slowly become a part of the WordPress community, the more I'm impressed by the feeling you get once you engage with the folks who are truly passionate about WordPress. That's really what propels any project onto something bigger and better than most. It's not just driven solely by profits or client needs, but by passion. Anyone working for a nonprofit can get behind that.
