I'm really proud of how [Accessible Zen has evolved](/tag/accessible-zen/) in the last few months. Today it reaches another important milestone: it's first beta release.

The first beta release gets thorough documentation, which you can [check out in the Github repository](https://github.com/davidakennedy/accessible-zen/blob/master/accessible-zen-documentation.txt).

Here are the rest of the release details:

- [Add documentation](https://github.com/davidakennedy/accessible-zen/issues/33).
- [Read More Posts link now more versatile](https://github.com/davidakennedy/accessible-zen/issues/36).

Recent hotfixes include:

- A [better Read More Posts link](https://github.com/davidakennedy/accessible-zen/issues/35).
- Other small fixes.

## What's Next?

I wrote in the [last release](/blog/accessible-zen-version-0-1-alpha-4-available/) that I hoped this would be the first and only beta release. That's still the goal. I plan to double check everything, making any needed fixes or additions and releasing soon. Any of those fixes and additions will be deployed to the master branch on Github. We're getting so close!

I’d love to hear what you think! You can submit feedback on the [GitHub issues section](https://github.com/davidakennedy/Accessible-Zen/issues), or by emailing me at <me@davidakennedy.com>.

This is an Beta release. That means it's close to finished, but not quite there yet. I'm still developing the theme and I really don’t recommend that you run it on a production site — set up a test site just to play with it.
