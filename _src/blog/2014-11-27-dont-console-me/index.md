Steam's big holiday sale [started yesterday](http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/26/7295229/steam-black-friday-holiday-sale-valve-pc-deals). Like most Steam sales, I still have games I bought from the last sale I haven't played yet. ðŸ™‚ But that's okay. I also have an XBox 360 I haven't touched in awhile. That's better than okay.

I grew up as a hardcore console gamer, owning and/or playing almost every system since the Commodore 64. The Xbox 360 may be my last. Well, except for maybe a [Steam Box](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3958162/valve-steam-box-cake). No games on the consoles excite me. Nothing exist there that I can't find on my gaming PC. I bought an Xbox 360 because of Gears of War. I don't see that type of lure now.

I purchased my gaming PC about 18 months ago and love it. Games are cheaper, more plentiful, and the platform comes with more flexibility. Now I just need a bigger hard drive or more hard drives to store more games. Part of me misses the types of memories I formed around consoles when I was a kid, but I think I'm just fine without them. Don't console me.
