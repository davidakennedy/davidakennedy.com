In life, you often need someone to give you a nudge.

That nudge can come in many forms. A word of encouragement that ups your confidence. A long, heartfelt chat that makes you pause, think and change direction. Or an idea you can take on as your own. That's just to name a few.

A few days ago, I heard that Joseph O’Connor, a well-respected accessibility advocate, died after a long battle with chronic illness. You can read more about Joe in the [announcement on his website](http://www.blacktelephone.com/2020/01/remembering-joseph-oconnor/), and in a [nice round-up from Dennis Lembree](http://www.webaxe.org/passing-of-joseph-oconnor/). Deborah Edwards-Onoro also has a [lovely goodbye on her blog](https://www.lireo.com/saying-goodbye-to-joe-oconnor/). Mike Gifford created a [well-deserved Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karr_O%E2%80%99Connor) for Joe.

Hearing this news made me deeply sad. Joe helped my career in a way I'm not sure he realized, so I wanted to that share here.

I connected with Joe as a member of the WordPress Accessibility team — how I started contributing to WordPress. Along with Joe, Joe Dolson, Rian Rietveld and Graham Armfield, welcomed my contributions and gave me a home where I felt useful and valued. Joe and I worked together the most on his [Cities initiative](http://accessiblejoe.com/cities/), which aimed to increase the number of accessibility-ready WordPress themes. I decided to design and build a theme representing Washington D.C. It didn't quite work out that way though.

I had wanted to create and release a public WordPress theme for awhile. But I stopped short of creating one because I didn't know how it would be different than everything already out there. Joe's Cities idea gave me the "nudge" I needed. Accessibility would be the difference in what I made!

As I mentioned, things didn't go exactly to plan. Once I started brainstorming design ideas, I got more excited about making a minimalistic design, inspired by [Zen Habits](https://zenhabits.net/). [Accessible Zen was born](/blog/accessible-zen-an-accessible-wordpress-theme/), and I released it in June, 2013. I needed that nudge, even if what I made didn't fit into Joe's vision. I still learned a ton, and put something accessible out into the world.

Releasing the theme also gave me the confidence to apply to speak at my first WordCamp. The organizers [accepted my talk about Accessible Zen](https://2014.lancasterpa.wordcamp.org/session/lessons-from-building-an-accessible-wordpress-theme/), and I delivered it in early 2014. Shortly after, I began a trial at Automattic to work on its Theme Team. I landed that gig, and it shaped my career in countless ways.

All thanks to a nudge from "Accessible" Joe O’Connor. Someone I admired who took the time to share his big idea, and his expertise. Thank you, Joe. I won't forget what you did and I'll miss your voice in our community.
