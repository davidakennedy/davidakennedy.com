Planning any large, group project can prove daunting.

However, with some creative thinking and teamwork, group members can accomplish a lot of pre-planning before any boots hit the ground. That's something I'm realizing with one big project I'm working on right now.

## The Adventure

I'll be creating a digital prospectus for an elementary school in London with 10 classmates of mine. The project is part of the curriculum in my [Interactive Media Master&#8217;s program](http://www.elon.edu/e-web/academics/communications/interactive_media/) at [Elon University](http://www.elon.edu/).

My [34 classmates and I](http://www.elon.edu/e-web/academics/communications/interactive_media/imediaclass2009.xhtml) will embark on four separate projects for public good around the world. We leave for London, Costa Rica and Panama in the coming days.

## The Challenge

As my group members and I have planned how to attack our project, we've faced a few challenges. One of the biggest has been how to organize our creative teams.

We will develop a multimedia website for our client that tells its story. This will include photos, videos, text and more. To effectively gather the content we need, using all the technology available to us, we've split ourselves into three creative teams. Each team has three to four people.

## The Solution

How could we divide our team's talents and divvy up responsibilities without locking anyone into a role for good?

We took each person's talents into account, placing a strong videographer, photographer and interviewer in each group. Then we developed a varied roles within each group for the members to keep in mind as they were out collecting content.

Obviously, we will have one person responsible for shooting video and one person responsible for shooting photos. The third role is the storyteller. When this person isn't interviewing folks, he or she will be required to have an eye for what the videographer and photographer might be missing.

Are they missing any shots or angles? Who are the most engaging subjects or characters? They are a producer, more or less.

It's not terribly innovative, but these roles will be interchangeable among group members, giving people the opportunity to try different tasks. And what could happen if we fail to have someone keeping their eye on the story?

I shudder just thinking about it.
