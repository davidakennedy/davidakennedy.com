Two weeks ago I listened to Norman Casiano, a victim of the attack at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, [tell his story](https://www.facebook.com/nytimes/videos/10150827346724999/). I still hear the fear and force in his voice. You can't listen to him and not think that something has to be done about not just gun control, but the lack of equality and empathy in America. That change starts with listening. To each other.

This shooting shook me more than others. Maybe because it happened in my home state. Maybe I'm scared of the world that my daughter is growing up in. Maybe I've hit my limit of inaction. I keep thinking of one of my favorite quotes from one of my heros, [Harry T. Moore](http://www.harryharriettemoore.org):

> "Freedom never descends upon a people. It is always bought with a price."
