A few weeks ago, Automattic held its annual Grand Meetup. That's where the company I work for gathers together in one place for a week to strategize, work and bond. Every year, we throw a party at the end of the week, complete with a photo booth. Piling into the photo booth (or in this case, photo area) has turned into one of my favorite things.

Of course, we also took a serious one.

Between all the work, I had a bit of fun too. A few nice hikes, plus a ride up a mountain in a gondola. We saw a bear! Although, I didn't snap a great picture of it. One of these days I'm just going to move to the mountains because I love it so much. ðŸ™‚

Here's to another great year at Automattic, surrounded by awesome colleagues with a worthwhile mission!
