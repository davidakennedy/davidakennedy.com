The WordPress community has made some great progress recently toward better accessibility.

Graham Armfield has updated everyone on all the [recent work in core regarding accessibility tickets](http://www.coolfields.co.uk/2012/11/wordpress-3-5-accessibility-update-november-2012/). And the Community Summit generated [good discussion on potential future progress](http://make.wordpress.org/summit/2012/12/03/accessibility/).

I'm so excited by all this – especially my part – helping out on the [Cities project to create accessible WordPress themes](/blog/joining-the-cities-project/). I'd say to anyone reading this who has any expertise in accessibility – think about how you can help. If we want WordPress to continue this progress toward better overall accessibility, we have to make it happen.
