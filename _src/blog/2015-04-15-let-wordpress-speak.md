> WordPress 4.2 is shipping with a useful new JavaScript method: wp.a11y.speak(). This is a utility to make it easy for WordPress core to create consistent methods for providing live updates for JavaScript events to users of screen readers â€“ with the side benefit that developers of plug-ins and themes can also make use of it either on the front or back end.

From [Let WordPress Speak: New in WordPress 4.2](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/04/15/let-wordpress-speak-new-in-wordpress-4-2/) on Make WordPress Accessible.

I'm excited about this upcoming feature in WordPress and its ability to make modern, snappy JavaScript-powered pieces of WordPress a great experience for screen reader users.
