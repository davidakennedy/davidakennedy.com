Today, we started a few new traditions for the holidays as a family.

1. We baked cookies as a new thing to do on Christmas day. We now have a batch of peanut butter and a batch of chocolate chocolate chip with a batch of sugar coming up in the next day or so. We also made homemade pumpkin pie as a bonus.
2. We watched a <del>trilogy</del>. Okay, not really. We only made it through the [first Lord of the Rings movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring). It turns out it's hard to make it through a trilogy when you get up late, have to change diapers and chat with relatives most of the day. ðŸ™‚

Hopefully, we can keep these traditions going no matter where we are on Christmas day. We may have to start the cookie baking earlier for future visits from Santa for the kiddo.
