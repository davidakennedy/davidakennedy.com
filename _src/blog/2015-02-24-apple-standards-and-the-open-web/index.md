[Pointer Events have become a W3C recommendation](http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/4430?pk_campaign=feed&pk_kwd=pointer-events-is-a-w3c-recommendation), but it's not all good news as Tim Kadlec points out in [Apple's Web?](http://www.timkadlec.com/2015/02/apples-web/)

> Apple simply does not play well with other vendors when it comes to standardization. The same sort of things we once criticized Microsoft for doing long ago, we give Apple a pass on today. They’re very content to play in their own little sandbox all too often.
