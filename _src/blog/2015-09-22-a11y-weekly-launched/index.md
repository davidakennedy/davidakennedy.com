About a month ago, I started chipping away at a simple idea: [launching a weekly newsletter about accessibility](/blog/a11y-weekly/). I put it live quietly over the weekend. If you're interested in getting to know and keeping up with the accessibility world, you should sign up.

Just visit [a11yweekly.com](http://a11yweekly.com/) and fill in your email. I'll send out the first issue next week. I also have the [code available on Github](https://github.com/davidakennedy/a11yweekly.com), if that's your thing.

I imagine the site and newsletter will evolve quite a bit over time, but more on that in future blog posts. If you have suggestions, send me a note via my [contact page](/contact/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy), or to <hello@a11yweekly.com>.
