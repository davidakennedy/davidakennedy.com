A page detailing what I'm reading currently. Any must-read recommendations will have a heart &hearts; next to them. That means I could see myself reading it again. Other books may be worth reading, but I may not get as much value out of rereads.

You can also see what I read in past years, at least when I began keeping track of it:

{% set posts = collections.readinglists %}
{% include "partials/post-list.njk" %}

The list:

1. _The Fellowship of the Ring_ by J.R.R. Tolkien
2. _The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming_ by David Wallace-Wells
3. _Burn Book: A Tech Love Story_ by Kara Swisher
4. _How to Write One Song: Loving the Things We Create and How They Love Us Back_ by Jeff Tweedy
5. _The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt_ by Edmund Morris
