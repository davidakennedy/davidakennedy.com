A page detailing what I'm reading currently. Any must-read recommendations will have a heart &hearts; next to them. That means I could see myself reading it again. Other books may be worth reading, but I may not get as much value out of rereads.

You can also see what I read in past years, at least when I began keeping track of it:

{% set posts = collections.readinglists %}
{% include "partials/post-list.njk" %}

The list:

1. _A Court of Mist and Fury_ by Sarah J. Maas
2. _Small Things Like These_ by Claire Keegan
3. _All Systems Red_ by Martha Wells
