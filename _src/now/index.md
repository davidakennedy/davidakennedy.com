A page detailing what I'm focused on at the moment. I'll update it when things change.

I'm currently:

- still warming up after joining a new team at Ad Hoc, working on Benefit Tools for Veterans at the Department of Veteran Affairs. I'm back to focusing on accessibility work. I'm also managing more people, which has been fun and challenging.
- reading at a steady pace, but still haven't returned to physical books like I wanted.
- doing a lot of kettlebell workouts and enjoying the heck out of it. I'm alternating between two major workouts, and it's both challenging and flexible for the time I have available.
- forever working through Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Such a fun game!
